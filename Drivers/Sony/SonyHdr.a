;
;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	   <SM9>	  1/4/94	LB		Added INCLUDEs of the files SonySWIM3AMIC.a and SonySWIM3GC.a,
;									which contain vectorized hardware-specific DMA access routines.
;	   <SM8>	  2/5/93	GMR		Added universal checks for SWIM3Exists to header, to support
;									SWIM3 on PDM.
;	   <SM7>	12/14/92	RC		Restore Pre-PDM d2 with Horror Roll-in
;	   <SM5>	 12/8/92	rab		Removed a couple of PadForOverpatch conditionals that I missed.
;	   <SM4>	 12/7/92	rab		Roll in Horror changes. Comments follow…
;		<H6>	  6/3/92	SWC		Added an include of DockingEqu.a.
;		<H5>	11/14/91	SWC		Added "WITH SonyDriveRec, SonyDriverVars" since driver and drive
;									variables are now defined in record format.
;		<H4>	11/14/91	SWC		Added _SCCPoll macro to make it easier to change the code to
;									handle the SCC modem port polling. Also cleaned up the comments.
;		<H2>	10/18/91	CMP		Added support for SWIM2.  Also moved SonyRawTrack.a and SonyPatches.a
;									so they were included before SonyRAM.a.  Otherwise they don't get
;									included into the RAM driver.
;	   <SM3>	 5/17/92	kc		Include PowerPrivEqu.
;	   <SM2>	 4/27/92	JSM		Get rid of conditionals: supportsDCD is always false,
;									hasIopSwim, forROM, supportsMFM, forDiskDup, isUniversal are
;									always true, this obsoletes the files SonyDCD.a and SonyRAM.a;
;									left in the padForOverpatch conditional for now.
;		 <3>	 6/12/91	LN		removed #include 'HardwareEqu.a'
;		 <2>	 1/11/90	CCH		Added include of “HardwarePrivateEqu.a”.
;	   <2.5>	12/11/89	GGD		Optimized universal Prime and Control dispatching to just jump
;									through the vector, since both IOP and Classic drivers now use
;									the same vectors.
;	   <2.4>	 5/23/89	GGD		Re-organized to allow assembly of both standard and IOP versions
;									for universal ROM. Added driver header, and version equates from
;									Sony.a
;	   <2.3>	 4/29/89	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <2.2>	 4/10/89	gmr		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <2.1>	 2/21/89	GGD		SWC/Added TimeVIADB conditionally if undefined.
;	   <2.0>	12/15/88	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <1.2>	11/21/88	CCH		Changed ForRam equates to ForRom.
;	   <1.1>	11/11/88	CCH		Fixed Header.
;	   <1.0>	 11/9/88	CCH		Adding to EASE.
;	   <2.0>	 10/7/88	rwh		added support for IOP based sony driver
;	  <•1.9>	 9/23/88	CCH		Got rid of inc.sum.d and empty nFiles
;	   <1.8>	 9/19/88	GGD		SWC Added forDiskDup conditional and SonyDup.a include
;	   <1.7>	 8/16/88	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <1.6>	 7/15/88	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <1.5>	 6/15/88	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <1.4>	 5/25/88	GGD		No changes to this file, entire Sony Driver is checked out and
;									in as a group.
;	   <1.3>	 5/23/88	GGD		No changes, entire sony driver checked out and in as a group.
;	   <1.2>	  5/3/88	GGD		No changes, entire sony driver checked out and in as a group.
;	   <1.1>	 4/18/88	GGD		Merged in MFM support <C437> by Steve Christensen Updated
;									INCLUDEs / LOADs to eleminate xFiles and nFiles that are no
;									longer used, in favor of the official Files from AIncludes
;	   <1.0>	 2/12/88	BBM		Adding file for the first time into EASE…
;	  <C437>	11/21/86	SWC		Added supportsMFM conditional and SonyMFM.a include
;									(conditionally) for MFM/SuperDrive support.
;	  <A351>	 11/5/86	TJ		Removed a few years worth of comments, added missing END
;									statement ...
;	  <A216>	10/16/86	TJ		Added nFSPrivate.a include so SonyRAM can get at HFSDebug.
;	  <C206>	10/12/86	bbm		made changes to get mpw aincludes to work
;	  <C123>	 10/1/86	TJ		Swapped over to MPW type includes; added SONYICON.A source file
;									include. (Sonyutil.a was getting ridiculuous.)

;

;
;	This is the official Mac disk driver.  It supports a
;	Sony-type (16 us/nybble) 3-1/2 inch disk drive in both the internal
;	and external ports.  It is fully asynchronous to
;	allow processing during power-up, seek and rotational
;	latency times.
;
;	Some of the lower level routines in this driver are
;	very timing sensitive and therefore cannot be changed
;	very easily.
;
;	Seek, Eject, and PowerOn wait times are returned to the
;	caller;  the VIA timer 2 is used exclusively by this disk driver to
;	measure these times and cause an interrupt back to this driver to
;	continue or complete a task.  To do this, the code is very
;	"level-specific".
;
;	A VBL task is used to look for disk-in-place and to power down
;	disk drives after a couple second delay when they are no longer in
;	use.
;

;<C37/3Jun86> LAK/CSL  Support 2nd internal floppy drive for Aladdin.
;
;<C123/01oct86> TJ	Swapped over to MPW type includes; added SONYICON.A
;					source file include. (Sonyutil.a was getting ridiculuous.)

;
;<C437/21nov86> SWC	Added supportsMFM conditional and SonyMFM.a include
;					(conditionally) for MFM/SuperDrive support.
;<1.8>			SWC	Added forDiskDup conditional and SonyDup.a include
;					(conditionally) for building a RAM-based version
;					of the driver for the Disk Duplicator program.
