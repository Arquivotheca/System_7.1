/*	File:		MemoryMgrPatches.c	Contains:	Process Mgr heap routines that manipulate the heap without direct				knowledge of whether the heap is 24-bit or 32-bit.  MemoryMgr24Patches.c				and MemoryMgr32Patches.c are virtually identical in source code.  The				header files each uses, though, determines the how the block header				access macros are expanded.  This (hopefully) makes it easier to				maintain given the 24/32 duality imposed on us.	Written by:	Phil Goldman	Copyright:	© 1986-1992 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.	Change History (most recent first):	 		<13>	10/28/92	DTY		Use new Get/Set macros to access ExpandMem.		<12>	 6/22/92	DTY		#1033275 <csd>: In ProcessManagerNewHiHandle, quad align the									blocks if we’re running on an 040 machine.  The alignment takes									the block header size into account, then subtracts it since									ChipOffRelocFromFree will add the block header size back on, so									the fudging is necessary to keep the block aligned properly.		<11>	 4/15/91	DFH		dba, WS#DFH-910415a : ReclaimSpaceIfSysHeapLow now checks									GetProcessMgrLoFreeBytes to see if enough is available there									without having to scan the system heap. This is often true, so									Process Mgr and Temp Memory allocations will be faster. We									noticed this with EPPC.		<10>	  4/9/91	DFH		VL, #83672 : Fixed ProcessMgrMaxBlock to use our own									GetProcessMgrHiMaxBlock, instead of MaxBlock, since we need to									avoid the straddle block area. That memory is accounted for in									StraddleBlockSize() and so a) the could be a block we could use									above the straddle, even if system heap preservation makes									StraddleBlockSize return 0, or b) if there is no such block									above the straddle, we would return MaxBlock() even though we									need to save it for the system.		 <9>	  4/7/91	DFH		gbm, WS#JC-PM-005 : Fix StraddleBlockSize to not return a number									less than the header size, since that memory can not really be									allocated.  Caused ProcessMgrMaxBlock (and therefore TempMaxMem)									to return negative number, since they subtract the header size									to convert to logical size.		 <8>	  4/4/91	DFH		VL, WS#JC-PM-005 : Fixed ProcessMgrMaxBlock to calculate correct									size. Was incorrect, sometimes negative (!), when there was no									room left in the Process Mgr zone.		 <7>	  4/3/91	DFH		kst, WS#DFH-910403a : Removed shortcut in ProcessMgrHiNewHandle									about whether to call ReclaimSpaceIfSysHeapLow. It was supposed									to do it only if the grow zone was NOT called, but the condition									was reversed. This meant we allowed ProcessMgrHiNewHandle to eat									too much of the System heap, resulting in needless shortages.									Checking bytesGrown was a bad idea anyway, since it ends up zero									even if the growzone succeeded. Removed the shortcut altogether									just to avoid problems.		 <6>	  4/2/91	DFH		ewa, #86189 : Added VM_HoldSystemHeap call in									LowerProcessMgrZoneBottom. This was being done by VM's patch to									the ProcessMgrGZProc. Unfortunately, it is impossible for such a									patch to work, since it needs to a) not eat any volatile									registers, b) not use any stack (since our glue crawls the									caller's stack to find the memory manager's A6 register), and c)									be reentrant.		 <5>	 3/14/91	DFH		gbm,#82504, #82681, #83168, #83182, #83207: Use new ExpandMem									variable for sys heap contiguity factor.		 <4>	 2/21/91	DFH		dba,#82504, #82681, #83168, #83182, #83207: Process Mgr heap									allocation now makes sure there is sufficient memory in the									system heap even when ProcessMgr zone doesn't need to grow.		 <2>	11/21/90	DFH		(with BBM) Fixed GZ proc parameter adjustments.  Fixed									ProcessMgrSysGZProc to pay attention to the result of chaining									through to the previous SysZone gzProc.  Also, use ROUTINE_ADDR									when stting gzProc, to bypass jump table.		 <0>	 x/xx/86	PYG		New Today.*/  #include <types.h>#include <memory.h>#include <menus.h>#include <files.h>#include <quickdraw.h>#include <windows.h>#include <osutils.h>#include <devices.h>#include <retrace.h>#include <resources.h>#include <segload.h>#include <errors.h>#include <GestaltEqu.h>#include <VMCallsPriv.h>#include "Glue.h"#include "Lomem.h"#include "Data.h"#include "SysMisc.h"#include "Patches.h"#include "Zone.h"/* Data internal to this file */static Ptr		oldSysGZProc;		/* old system heap grow zone procedure */ /* Function prototypes internal to this file */void			InitMPBlock(Ptr, u_size);void			InitHeapRoutines(void);long			ProcessMgrHMakeMoreMasters(void);#pragma segment INIT/* InitHeapRoutines.
