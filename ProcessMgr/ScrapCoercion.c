	Change History (most recent first):
	 
		<17>	  4/9/92	KST		#1027029,<JH>: Inform TSM when a non-TSM aware application is
									getting suspended so TSM can pull down input method's menu.
		<16>	 3/23/92	JSM		OSEvents.h is obsolete, use Events.h.
		<15>	 2/25/91	DFH		DC,WS#DFH-910225a: Fixed so GetScrap works even if called before
									first event call. IsScrapOwnedByCurrentProcess did not allow for
									case where MoveScrap() has not been called on the current app.
		<14>	 1/28/91	DFH		JSM,#81718:Fixed OrphanScrapIntoPartition to deal with case
									where SCRAPHANDLE is nil because scrap is on the disk.
		<12>	  1/8/91	DFH		(rdd) Changed StartForegroundSwitch to allow for case where
									current front process is suspended for high-level debugging.
		<11>	12/21/90	DFH		Fixed SetFirstDstCoercionState to set srcMyScrapInfo.pScrapOwner
									= pCurrentProcess when dst scrap is already up to date.
		<10>	12/18/90	DFH		Added GetScrap patch support routine.
		 <9>	12/18/90	DFH		Removed fgAppsUnexecuted mechanism, since front switch queue
									works better.
		 <8>	12/17/90	DFH		Fixed scrap retention devices.
		 <7>	12/15/90	DFH		Propagate correct scrap, even if some destination process
									doesn't have enough memory for it. True even if real scrap owner
									ExitToShell's.
		 <6>	12/11/90	DFH		CancelQuitAll now called only when FG switching out of intended
									victim. Other switches can be normal (e.g. when intended victim
									is a BG-only application).
		 <5>	12/10/90	DFH		Compiler bug workaround in MoveScrap.  Use SCRAPCOUNT += 1
									instead of SCRAPCOUNT++.
		 <4>	11/14/90	DFH		Change ScrapIO to use PBOpenDF instead of PBOpen.
		 <3>	 11/6/90	DFH		Use structure defs for menu bar access in CS_INIT.
		 <0>	 x/xx/86	PYG		New Today.
