And make surethat the file has write permission. Previous fix #39 did not work with a BTfile openedwith read only permission.> What was tested:Tested with Hae-sungÕs dictionary file, now we can open with read only permission.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/8/92 2:21:52 PMFile: BTreeFuncs.A,41Owner: Kenny S.
