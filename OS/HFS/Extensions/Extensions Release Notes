They are SuspendProcessManagerFileTracking and ResumeProcessMgrFileTracking. Currently these calls simply call begin and endsystemmode respectively. Eventually we will release these calls to developers.> What was tested:Wrote an init that calls these high-level dispatch calls instead of BeginSystemMode and EndSystemmode  from the OSDispatch trap. ----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
