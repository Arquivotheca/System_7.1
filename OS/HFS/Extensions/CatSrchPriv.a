;		 <8>	 9/13/91	JSM		Cleanup header.
;		 <7>	 2/25/91	dnf		dho,#83584: Include the fsSBNegate bit in the search criteria
;									that don't require ioSpec2 to be non-nil.
;		 <6>	10/30/90	dnf		(with dba) Add timerFired bit to CSSR.flags
;		 <5>	 8/28/90	dnf		Rename ioSpecBits to ioSearchBits, turn debugging off
;		 <4>	  6/2/90	dnf		Add flag for type of current record
;		 <3>	 2/26/90	dnf		Add timerWasInstalled bit
;		 <2>	  1/9/90	dnf		Add inclNames bit to CSSR.flags
;	   <1.4>	 8/26/89	dnf		Add flags bit for buffer on stack
;	   <1.3>	 7/31/89	dnf		Cleaned up some comments
;	   <1.2>	  7/6/89	dnf		Changed param block to support read buffer.
;	   <1.1>	 5/31/89	dnf		Got rid of fsSBxxx equates. They've been moved to HFS70Equ.a
;	   <1.0>	 5/30/89	dnf		Integrate CatSearch, FileID's and Desktop Database Mgr into one
