Gestalt Release NotesFirst created on: 4/9/92 6:08:16 PM----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/9/92 6:08:23 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,52Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫AIncludes∫File: GestaltEqu.h,53Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫CIncludes∫File: GestaltEqu.p,47Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫PInterfaces∫File: Sys.r,304Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Make∫File: GestaltFunction.a,42Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫OS∫Gestalt∫File: GestaltPatches.a,31Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫OS∫Gestalt∫File: PatchIIciROM.a,150Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Patches∫File: ShutDownMgr.a,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫ShutDownMgr∫File: SoundMgrPatch.a,25Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫SoundMgr∫Radar bug: #1026795> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 100, we need to change boxFlag on Macintosh LC II machinesfrom its original value of boxMacLC to boxMacLCII in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltMacLCII.  This hasimplicationsin several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the machine icon tablefor Gestalt (the same icon as the LC) and a new string in the machine name STR# in theSystem (”Macintosh LC II”), both of which show up in the Finder.  We need to make surethat Gestalt returns the same value for gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttras the Mac LC.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to set the CLUT to 50% gray on a restartas we do for an LC.  In the Sound Manager, we need to expand the sound primitive vectortableto include the LC II.> What was tested:On an LC II, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon andmachine string appear in About This Macintosh…, verified that the CLUT was set to 50%gray on restart, verified that sound input worked.  Didn’t check the returned values forgestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr, though.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/21/92 6:38:46 PMFile: GestaltPrivateEqu.a,40Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫Asm∫File: GestaltPatches.a,32Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫OS∫Gestalt∫File: PowerMgrPatches.a,15Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫OS∫PowerMgr∫Radar bug: #1026866> Release notes for this change:Hardware had an extension that fixes some problems with the PowerBooks.  We’re takingthree ofthem for CubeE.  Roll them into PowerMgrPatches.a, and add ‘bugz’ bits to tell theextension thatthese have been fixed in the system.> What was tested:These fixes have been verified by the hardware group, both as part of an extension, andas part ofthe base system.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/2/92 9:21:50 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,55Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫AIncludes∫File: GestaltEqu.h,56Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫CIncludes∫File: GestaltEqu.p,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫PInterfaces∫File: InternalOnlyEqu.a,22Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫Asm∫File: Sys.r,317Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Make∫File: GestaltPatches.a,33Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫OS∫Gestalt∫File: PatchIIciROM.a,153Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Patches∫File: ShutDownMgr.a,51Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫ShutDownMgr∫File: SoundMgrLowLevel.a,32Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫SoundMgr∫File: SoundMgrPatch.a,27Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫SoundMgr∫Radar bug: #1031451> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 140, we need to change boxFlag on PowerBook 145 machines fromits original value of boxPowerBook170 to boxPowerBook145 in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltPowerBook145.This has implications in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in themachine icon table for Gestalt (the same icon as the PowerBook 140) and a new string inthe machine name STR# in the System (”PowerBook 140.” for now, until we announce themachine (the period at the end will let you tell the difference in the meantime)), bothof which show up in the Finder.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to close the videodriver at shutdown or restart as we do for the 140 and 170. In the Sound Manager, we needto expand the sound primitive vector table to include the 145, and fool the Gestaltattribute table into thinking a 145 is really a 140.> What was tested:On a PowerBook 145, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right iconand machine string appear in About This Macintosh…, verified that playing a sound andsound input worked.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------
