; This lovely mechanism allows us to export BaseOfROM here for use,
; via the include file StartMacs.a, in all subsequent procs involved
; in the start code.  DO NOT MERGE THIS WITH FILE STARTINIT.
; The point is that BaseOfROM wants to be imported everywhere for
; use in such lovely macros as BigLEA, BigJSR, etc.
