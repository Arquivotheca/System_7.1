StartMgr Release NotesFirst created on: 3/16/92 4:15:39 PM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------3/16/92 4:15:59 PMFile: BootCode.a,18Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1024540> Release notes for this change:Load El Kabong printing extensions at boot time along with other types of extensions.> What was tested:Changed an extension to have a type of ÔpextÕ and watched it get loaded anyway.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------3/26/92 5:58:15 PMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,54Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºLinkedPatchesºFile: Build,255Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: SysObj.Make,447Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: BootCode.a,22Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: BeforePatches.a,27Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºPatchesºRadar bug: #1024282> Release notes for this change:A Process Manager segment was being loaded high in the system heap, causing fragmentation.  Itwas loaded high because the linked patch blocks were in the way at boot time.  We tried to alleviatethis by moving these blocks high in the heap, but that stopped working.  Now we load these segmentsin ÔPTCHÕ 0, which is run before linked patches, so we donÕt have to worry about the strangememory setup at linked patch time.> What was tested:The Process Manager segments in question are loaded low, always.  All the locked blocks are allin the lower third of the system heap, which is very good for fragmentation.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/1/92 9:08:46 PMFile: BootCode.a,24Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1025555> Release notes for this change:Add generic A/UX support to Cube-E boot code.> What was tested:The A/UX group tested the boot code with the changes under A/UX.  I verified that the changes donot affect the boot process of the normal system.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/2/92 3:48:07 PMFile: Bootcode.a,25Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: StartSystem.a,71Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1025555> Release notes for this change:Move the first call to MakeSystemHeapGrowable into StartSystem.a because there used to be onereally early in the boot process before all this Gibbly stuff came around.  We canÕt put it at thebeginning of BootCode.a because that would cause the Gibbly to get closed because of the call to_InitApplZone, so weÕre doing it before the Gibbly gets opened anyway.> What was tested:Booted machine, and the Gibbly kicked in.  With the call to MakeSystemHeapGrowable at thestart of BootCode.a, the Gibbly did not get executed, which is a bad thing.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/2/92 9:47:33 PMFile: BootCode.a,26Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1018711> Release notes for this change:Script Extensions can legally only reside in the Extensions folder. They should not be executed from the System Folder in the normal case. However, in the case of a bootable floppy, we frequently donÕt have enough of an environment to have a full System Folder structure. So, when we fail to find the Extensions folder when looking for Script Extensions, weÕll try the System Folder. But, if the Extensions folder is found, thatÕs the only place we look for them.> What was tested:I walked through this code with Macsbug and fooled it into thinking there was not Extensions folder. The code correctly redirected to the System Folder. Since this bug comes from Bruges, and we donÕt have a Hebrew-localized Cube-E boot disk, I was unable to check the specific case in the bug. But, the worst thing that could happen is the bug isnÕt fixed, and we have to live with the Bruges situation where Install 1 disks are not allowed to get unblessed.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/13/92 7:01:31 PMFile: BootCode.a,27Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1027105> Release notes for this change:DonÕt disable script extensions if the primary script is non-Roman, as a script extension isrequired for such systems.  Also, stripped out the skanky AppleTalk stuff that loaded a dummyLAP routine since AppleTalk 57.0.4 does that.> What was tested:Added Hebrew as a secondary script and rebooted.  The script extension is loaded if the shift keyis not held down, and not loaded if it is held down.  Made Hebrew the primary script.  The extensionloads whether or not the shift key is held down.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/15/92 11:53:39 PMFile: StartSystem.a,73Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1027491> Release notes for this change:Clear ioVRefNum before calling HGetFileInfo to find a Gibbly which can boot.  This field used tobe cleared by something that was moved into BootCode.a.  If weÕre lucky, this field will happento have 0, and Gibblies will work.  If weÕre not so lucky, this field will have garbage and GibblieswonÕt kick in.  If weÕre totally out of luck, weÕre running Cube-E on a new machine, and we windup with a sad Mac.> What was tested:DB-Lite is able to boot with this change.  My sample Gibbly that fixes a stupid MacTCP bug on myZydeco works.  (I wouldnÕt be able to finish the boot process without this fix.)----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/20/92 2:28:55 PMFile: Boot3.a,32Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1024149> Release notes for this change:DAL should not be disabled when AppleTalk is turned off, since it could be used throughthe serialport.  Take out the code which prevents DAL from loading if AppleTalk is off.> What was tested:Turned AppleTalk off from the Chooser, and rebooted.  After the machine has started up,DAL wasstill loaded, and taking up 20K for no good reason.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/29/92 5:37:48 PMFile: Boot3.a,34Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1027105> Release notes for this change:Took out code that prevented script extensions from being disabled at boot time whenRoman was not the primary script.The reasoning behind the code in the first place was that for other countries like Japan,for example, the script extensions are not optional software, and should not be disabledwhen the user holds down the shift key, since this would result in some strange stuffgoing on on the screen.  A change was made to the boot code to keep the script extensionsloading if Roman was not the primary script.This was fine and dandy.  The script extensions were always loading.  The problem wasthat the secondary inits, like Akiko and InputBackSupport were still being disabled.This obviously presents a problem to people who are trying to use the system.  This wouldbe further exacerbated in the future if third parties right input methods.  There is noelegant way to solve the general problem, and the solve the specific problem of Akiko andIBS isnÕt the right thing, so I took out the original change.  This puts us back to theway the world was under 7.0, GomTalk, and Bruges.> What was tested:Made sure that script systems are disabled when the shift key is held down, when Japanesewas both a primary and secondary script.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/28/92 6:22:39 PMFile: BootEqu.a,9Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: Boot2.a,75Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: Boot3.a,35Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1030972> Release notes for this change:If the ÔbootÕ 2 resource in the System file cannot find a Gibbly that knows how to bootthe machine, it used to put up a system error alert saying that the disk is too old to beused on this Macintosh.  When some code was moved from ÔbootÕ 2 into ÔbootÕ 3, the codethat set up the DSAT error table was moved too.  This prevents the error from beingdisplayed by the SysError call in ÔbootÕ 2, so it just sad Macs.  The reason the errortable initialization was moved into ÔbootÕ 3 was so that the standard one could beoverridden by a Gibbly.Changed ÔbootÕ 2 so that it sets a bit in low memory instead of calling SysError if itcanÕt find a Gibbly to boot with.  It then calls the SystemÕs ÔbootÕ 3 to display themessage.  Changed ÔbootÕ 3 to look at this bit right after the DSAT error table is setup.  If it sees that the bit is set, it will display the appropriate error, otherwise,the boot process continues.> What was tested:Edited the changed System fileÕs ÔgblyÕ resource so that it canÕt boot on a Mac IIci.Without another Gibbly that can boot the ci, the error that says that the disk is too oldfor this Macintosh is displayed.  When a Gibbly that can boot the machine is placed inthe System folder, the Gibbly gets the boot process, and the machine can boot.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/15/92 7:00:41 PMFile: Boot3.a,36     Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1032429> Release notes for this change:Comm Toolbox tools can have INITs in them. System 7 checked for INITs in Connectiontools, File Transfer tools, and Terminal Emulation tools. Telephone tools were notchecked for INITs, but should be.I changed the startup code to also check for INITs in Telephone tools. Telephone toolshave a type of ÔvbndÕ.> What was tested:I changed the type of the Caps Lock extension to ÔvbndÕ and verified that it loaded andfunctioned on my PowerBook.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/24/92 10:14:36 PMFile: GibblyMacros.a,5Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: Boot2.a,76Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: Boot3.a,37Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1033818> Release notes for this change:A Gibbly file may get closed before override patches are installed to prevent it frombeing closed if the system heap grows, forcing all files above the system resource map toclose down.  This was exhibited on a DB-Lite, trying to boot of an external hard drive byholding down command-option-shift-delete.Now, ÔbootÕ 2 places the GibblyÕs resource map underneath the system resource map so thatcalls to _RsrcZoneInit wonÕt close it.  The MakeGibblyResident macro has been updated tolook for the Gibbly at the bottom of the resource chain instead of the top.  A call to_UseResFile in ÔbootÕ 3 to force the system to be the current resource map before loadinglinked patches was removed now that the System file is at the top of the resource chainuntil MakeGibblyResident is called.> What was tested:Nick Vicaro moved the Gibbly below the system file in the resource chain in the DB-LiteGibbly to prove that this solution would prevent the Gibbly from being closed, and thiswas found to be true.  I did further testing on existing machines to ensure that thechanges made would not affect booting on a Gibbly-less machine, or a machine that thesystem can boot, but has an external Gibbly anyway, and all these cases worksuccessfully.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/27/92 4:03:30 PMFile: GibblyMacros.a,6Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: Boot2.a,77Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: Boot3.a,38Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1033818> Release notes for this change:Leave the reference number of the Gibbly in CurMap so that Gibblies will know what theirreference number is.> What was tested:Machines that do and donÕt require Gibblies to boot continue to do so.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/22/92 5:53:54 AMFile: Boot3.a,39     Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1018711> Release notes for this change:For our Install 1 disks, we donÕt have enough room to build a real System Folder. Soinstead, we put everything at the root of the disk and rely on the fact that the bootcode will default all file calls there. This is how the System and Finder are found evenif there isnÕt any blessed System Folder.Unfortunately, the Folder Manager doesnÕt have the same built-in defaults, so anyonerelying on finding things with the Folder Manager will fail on one of these magic Installdisks. The code to search for and load Script Extensions used the Folder Manager. Thismeant that WSI and WSII would not be loaded if there wasnÕt a System Folder.I tried to fix this in December by having the code try the System Folder if it couldnÕtfind an Extensions Folder. Now, if it doesnÕt find a System Folder either, it goes aheadand tries the default directory, which is the root.> What was tested:I put a Hebrew System, WorldScriptª I, and the Installer on a floppy. Before my change,when I booted it, alerts would come up in Chicago instead of the Hebrew font. After mychange, alerts come up with Hebrew characters and are right-justified.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/13/92 11:30:56 AMFile: Boot3.a,40     Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºStartMgrºRadar bug: #1039434> Release notes for this change:QuickTime 1.0 had a bug where it wouldnÕt register any of itÕs components if theComponent Manager was already installed.  To fix this problem, Cube-E has some code inthe boot code that loads QuickTimeÕs components for it.  The difference is that QuickTimeonly loads itÕs components when the CPU is a 68020 or better, whereas Cube-E alwaysloaded the components.  This causes a problem with QuickTime 1.5 and the Photo CD codec,since it winds up getting called on a 68000, which is bad because itÕs using 68020instructions.  Add a check in the boot code to make sure weÕre not on a 68000 CPU beforeloading QuickTime components.> What was tested:Verified that QuickTimeÕs components are not loaded on a Mac Plus, but are loaded on aIIci.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------9/2/93 2:33:59 AMFile: StartBoot.a,52     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºOSºStartMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,16     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: #1108969, 1106433> Release notes for this change:1108969:  Made sure that notification was available at init time.  This means changingStartBoot.a to call initialize me in the ROM version and it means having no processmanager dependencies.I also make sure I am using the system heap when I allocate apple events.  I switched thecode to assume that registered notification procs are responsible for disposing their ownapple events.1106433:  I fixed my use of CopyPixMap so that I no longer count on QuickDraw to do theright thing with nil color tables.  I cleaned up the code a little around there so I amnot making bad assumptions about ports.> What was tested:1106433:  Built and tested on PDM running NQD extension provided by Shannon to determinethat a) if I make the CopyPixMap call with a nil color table it works (although itreturns an error) and b) that I no longer use a nil color table and so I get no error atall.1108969:  Built a small test tool extension that registers itself at init time and dumpsthe apple events from display manager.  The tool can also remove notification procs.  Ichecked that the procs are correctly installed, that notification happens, that removalworks.  I checked that removing all the procs works, that removing some of the procsworks,  that installing one proc works, that installing multiple procs works.  Everythingseeems cool now.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
