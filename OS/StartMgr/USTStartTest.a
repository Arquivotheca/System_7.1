;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	   <SM3>	 5/17/92	kc		Include GestaltEqu.a
;	   <SM2>	  5/1/92	kc		Roll in Horror. Comments Follow:
;									Backed out change <H4>
;		<H4>	  3/6/92	AL		As a result of the PROC conditionalizing, the UST files have
;									grown too large for their space in the ROM. Therefore, I broke
;									out USTTestMgr.a and USTPram.a and put them into a new
;									"super-PROC" file called USTStartTest1.a. All future UST source
;									files should go in there. The room left by removing them can be
;									used by the file USTSubtests.a (the CPU-specific test tables)
;									for  growth as more machines are added to Horror.
;		<H3>	01/27/92	jmp		Changed the UST start part of HORROR to be one giant assembly,
;									and conditionlized so that it would be easy to go back to the
;									old way if necessary.  Also, padded out the UST part of HORROR
;									to match the TERROR/Zydeco ROM map.
;		<H2>	 1/14/92	SWC		Removed boxMacIIsi equate since it's now defined in Private.a.
;		<T7>	 5/23/91	HJR		Added include to PowerPrivEqu.a.
;		<T6>	 2/18/91	djw		Rolled in Scott Smyer's changes
;		<T5>	 1/24/91	CCH		Rolled in changes from Scott Smyers.
;		<T4>	 1/14/91	CCH		Rolled in Scott Smyers' changes.
;		<T3>	12/14/90	HJR		Added includes of the new files and some local boxflag equates
;									util the V8 and SI are rolled in.
;		<T2>	10/25/90	CCH		Included HardwarePrivateEqu.a instead of HardwareEqu.a.
;		<15>	 1/13/92	RB		Updated to reflect Terror changes.
;		<14>	 9/18/91	JSM		Cleanup header.
;		<13>	 6/12/91	LN		removed #include 'HardwareEqu.a'
;		<12>	 5/23/91	dba		get rid of warning
;		<11>	 9/11/90	SS		commented out the includes for the CTE code for now.
;		<10>	  9/4/90	SS		Added includes for the UTE kernel interface files.
;		 <9>	 4/20/90	SS		Added include of EgretEqu.a.  I am now using equates from this
;									file as per suggestion in the code review of 4/16/90.
;		 <8>	 2/27/90	SS		Removing the include of EgretEqu.a.  The equates that I was
;									using from that file I copied into STEqu.a.
;		 <7>	 2/16/90	SS		Added flags to statements which were changed to support Ericson.
;		 <6>	 2/15/90	SS		Conditionalized the include of EgretEqu.a
;		 <5>	 2/12/90	MA		Now INCLUDE 'EGRETEqu.a'.
;		 <4>	 1/11/90	CCH		Added include of “HardwarePrivateEqu.a”
;		 <3>	  1/4/90	BG		Added an ENDIF to the IF CPU = ... stuff.
;		 <2>	  1/4/90	BG		Added a MACHINE MC68040 directive for Eclipse and other -040-
;									based machines. Also, converted header to ProjectOr.
;	   <1.2>	 12/8/89	GMR		Added RPUBit to USP flags, for Zone-5 Parity support.
;	   <1.1>	 6/13/89	GMR		Added file USTCritTests.a which contains Gary D's fast Mod3Test.
;	   <1.0>	 6/11/89	GMR		Added for first time to EASE.
