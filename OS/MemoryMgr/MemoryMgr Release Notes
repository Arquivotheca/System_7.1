MemoryMgr Release NotesFirst created on: 4/29/92 7:42:40 PM----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/29/92 7:42:51 PMFile: MemoryMgrPatches.a,16Owner: Greg Marriott     Project: MainProj∫OS∫MemoryMgr∫Radar bug: #1027970> Release notes for this change:Make the memory manager stop crashing when fake handles are used in 32-bit mode with morethan 16MB RAM installed.  A feature to support the 32-bit ROM resource zone when allother zones are 24-bit zones was mistakenly triggering when the system was already in32-bit mode.  The fix is to not recheck a zone if the machine is already in 32-bit mode.> What was tested:I stepped through a case that crashes without the fix and also stepped through the samecase with the fix installed.  The fix successfully failed (how’s THAT for confusing)after only one zone check instead of switching to 24 bit mode and performing the second(doomed) zone check.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------
