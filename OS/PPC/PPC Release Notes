PPC Release NotesFirst created on: 7/5/92 2:10:19 AM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/5/92 2:10:28 AMFile: PPCBrowserPriv.h,18     Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºPPCºRadar bug: #1034096> Release notes for this change:The PPC Browser was using Geneva 12 as the hard-coded font and size for the lists. ThisdoesnÕt work for non-Roman primary scripts like Japanese. I changed the font used to 1which will cause the application font to be used, and I changed the size used to 0 whichwill use the ÒdefaultÓ font size. This will cause the correct font and size to be used innon-Roman script systems.Note that this has no real effect on the Roman system since Geneva 12 is the applicationfont and default size.> What was tested:I used the PPC browser (from Hypercard as in the bug) in a Roman system and verified thatit came up in Geneva 12 just like before. Then I used the PPC browser from a system withJapanese as the primary script. Osaka 12 was used. I made sure that a machine with aJapanese name was displayed correctly.Finally, I used Macsbug to change the text size used to 14 and made sure that the listswould format correctly with non-12 point text. This is important in case a script systemwants to use a size other than 12 for its default size.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/2/93 4:50:37 PMFile: GestaltEqu.h,15     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DepVideoEqu.a,47     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºAsmºFile: PPCInit.c,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºOSºPPCºFile: InitItt.c,19     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºOSºSCSIMgr4pt3ºFile: ThingManager.c,14     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: ThingManagerDisp.a,4     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: ThingManagerDispatcher.a,3     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,11     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Reality update:  Fix gestalt calls to use new prototype (not code change just typedeclarations).  Partially updated gestalt header file (except I did not move the errordeclarations that should probably be in Errors.h and I did not change the formattingdifferences).> What was tested:Build and tested.  Found one technically incorrect declaration (but implemented correctlyin assmbler.  Other than that everything seems to work fine.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
