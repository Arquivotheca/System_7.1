;									<H2> 11/18/92 BG Added a check to the InstallFPSP code so that it does NOT
;													 install itself if running on an 68LC040.

;		 <3>	 3/30/91	BG		New package based on Motorola Release 1.0 with numerous bug
;									fixes added
;		 <2>	  2/1/91	BG		Added code to go to the original system F-Line handler if the
;									FPU emulation package does not know what to do with a given
;									F-Line instruction that it encounters.
;		 <1>	12/14/90	BG		First checked into TERROR/BBS.
