SCSIMgr Release NotesFirst created on: 3/17/92 6:11:02 PM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------3/17/92 6:11:09 PMFile: SCSIMgrHW96.a,3Owner: pete helme     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºRadar bug: #1021847> Release notes for this change:Fix the removable device bug (CD ROMs etc.) on Quadras which caused the ÒThis disk is unreadable.  Do you want to format?Ó dialog to randomly appear.  Apparently there is a bug in the 53C96 chip which causes the FIFO count to get stuck on occasion.  We now flush the FIFO buffer to make sure the count is correct.> What was tested:This fix was originally run on a Quadra for several hours and the dialog never came up.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/22/92 4:13:33 PMFile: SCSIEqu96.a,2Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: SCSIPriv.a,17Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: SCSIMgr96.a,4Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºFile: SCSIMgrHW96.a,5Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºFile: SCSIMgrInit96.a,4Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºRadar bug: #1029009> Release notes for this change:From James BlairÕs release notes:ÒThe bug involves the incorrect recovery of writeback data.  The order of the writebackshas been modified to be correct (using the Motorola Ô040 specification).ÒModification to the DREQ bit testing has been implemented.  Instead of using animmediate btst value (very BAD for compatibility and maintainability! - especially forthe braindead Quadra SCSI address space) a SCSI Mgr global was setup for the bitlocation.> What was tested:ÒThese mods were tested for hours on the hardware that the bug was reported and other C96based Macs.Ó----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/31/92 12:52:40 AMFile: SCSILinkPatch.a,14     Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºRadar bug: #1035754> Release notes for this change:This is the fix for the now-famous System Error #41 problem caused by the Quantumfirmware bug. The short description of the problem is this:Quantum 40MB and 80MB drives have a bug in their firmware which can cause their cache tobecome corrupt. A subsequent read of data in the cache returns bad data withoutregistering an error. During boot, this can happen with the data for the FinderÕsresource map causing the Finder to fail to load.For the Quantum bug to manifest, several conditions all have to be just right: the amountof data being read must be within a certain range; another read of a small amount mustfollow quickly; the data must be stored in a particular configuration on the disk. Toprevent this bug from happening, we make sure that the second read doesnÕt happen quicklyenough. This is done by adding a delay between the two reads.We want to delay for about 25ms, which weÕve rounded up to 30ms for safety. But we onlywant to delay if we have to. We decide that we have to when: a read of 10 to 15 blockshas happened last AND another read is about to occur before 30ms have passed. When theseconditions do occur, we delay for 30ms MINUS the time that has already passed. Forexample, if 8ms passes between the first read and the second, we add only 22ms of delay.This is to minimize the performance penalty for this workaround.This delay logic has to be inside of the SCSI driver, which is read from the hard disk atboot time. Since we want to fix the problem with Cube-E, whether or not the user hasupdate the driver on the disk, we patch all SCSI drivers in RAM. This patch uses the samemechanism used by the 7.0 tune up. We check the code in RAM to make sure it is what weexpect it to be. If it is, we change a few instructions into a JSR into our patch. (We doflush the cache for Õ040 fans.) If the code is not what we expect, which will happen ifweÕve already patched that driver once or if itÕs a non-Apple driver, or if itÕs aversion of the driver we donÕt know about, then we donÕt change anything.> What was tested:I ran the system with this patch on my Quadra 950 (which has version $27 of the SCSIdriver) and verified with Macsbug that the driver was indeed patched in RAM. The driverkept working fine and I saw that the delay was in fact happening periodically.We have a Vail that has a 100% reproducable case of the System Error #41 crash. I put inthe System with the fix and the crash could not be reproduced. Just to make sure that thenew system wasnÕt affecting anything else, I made an INIT version of the fix and added itto the configuration that would always crash. Once again, the crash would no longerhappen.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/1/92 4:30:07 PMFile: SCSILinkPatch.a,15     Owner: Chris Derossi     Project: MainProjºOSºSCSIMgrºRadar bug: #1035754> Release notes for this change:This is a better fix for the now-famous System Error #41 problem caused by the Quantumfirmware bug.

Toprevent this bug from happening, we make sure that the size of the read is never in thedangerous range of 10-15 blocks. We do this by changing any such read into two smallerreads. This is better than the delay fix because it adds far less overhead.This block size logic has to be inside of the SCSI driver, which is read from the harddisk atboot time.

So, I turnoff interrupts while weÕre patching the driver and reenable them after the caches havebeen flushed.> What was tested:I created an INIT version of the patch and ran it. I watched it execute with Macsbug, andeverything looked fine. I also made sure that the driver was patched correctly in RAM.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
