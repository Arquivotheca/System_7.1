;	   <LW2>	 6/11/93	chp		Add a deferred task record to the Reliability Manager globals
;									and bump the globals’ version number from 1 to 2. The original
;									Time Manager task is now deferred until interrupts are enabled.
;		 <4>	 8/22/91	JSM		Clean up header.

;	   <1.1>	 7/16/89	GGD		Fixed RelPwrMask which is supposed to be a 19 bit mask, but was
;									only 18.
