LinkedPatches Release NotesFirst created on: 3/26/92 5:57:47 PM----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------3/26/92 5:57:54 PMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,54Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫File: Build,255Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Make∫File: SysObj.Make,447Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Make∫File: BootCode.a,22Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫OS∫StartMgr∫File: BeforePatches.a,27Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Patches∫Radar bug: #1024282> Release notes for this change:A Process Manager segment was being loaded high in the system heap, causing fragmentation.  Itwas loaded high because the linked patch blocks were in the way at boot time.  We tried to alleviatethis by moving these blocks high in the heap, but that stopped working.  Now we load these segmentsin ‘PTCH’ 0, which is run before linked patches, so we don’t have to worry about the strangememory setup at linked patch time.> What was tested:The Process Manager segments in question are loaded low, always.  All the locked blocks are allin the lower third of the system heap, which is very good for fragmentation.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/4/92 9:44:14 AMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,55Owner: Fred Monroe     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫Radar bug: #1024666> Release notes for this change:Made Linked patches more memory friendly so that we can boot in low memory conditions. The ‘lpch’ resources are moved above the boot globals (MemTop/2 + 1k) during the linkpatch loading. After this time MemTop is reset and the copied resources disappear.> What was tested:Booted a 2 meg machine with and without VM turned on. Walked through the process in macsbug.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/6/92 5:04:53 PMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,56Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫Radar bug: #1024666> Release notes for this change:Linked Patch INITs were broken with the last change because D4 was not being initialized.  Fix thisup and added judicious comments that Fred was too whipped to add because his ride was here.> What was tested:Kenny’s TSM INIT was crashing because of this bug.  With this fix, his INIT boots successfully.  Alsostepped through the system boot to make sure all the linked patches got copied to the right place,and MemTop was being restored afterwards.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/8/92 6:13:49 PMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,58Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫Radar bug: #1026928> Release notes for this change:Changed linked patch loader so that it will be able to get linked patch resources out of ROM.  Beforeloading each ‘lpch’ resource, see if CurMap is 1.  If it is, set ROMMapInsert to true to get theresource from ROM.  ROM Gibblies will know to set CurMap to 1 before calling the linked patchloader.> What was tested:Changed CurMap to 1, and watched linked patch loader set ROMMapInsert to true before getting an‘lpch’ resource.  Of course, since there are no linked patches in ROM on a IIci, the machine bombedvery shortly afterwards.  But that wasn’t the point of this change.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/30/92 2:50:28 PMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,59Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫Radar bug: #1023455> Release notes for this change:The check in the hasTerror runtime conditional to check for Horror ROMs was looking atthe wrong offset into the ROM header.  It was looking at decimal offset 14 instead of hexoffset 14.  Change the code to use the correct offset.> What was tested:The implication of this bug was that non of the Terror only linked patches were beingloaded on Horror ROM based machines, like Vail.  With the change, these patches are nowloaded.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/3/92 10:34:40 AMFile: LinkedPatchLoader.a,60Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫LinkedPatches∫Radar bug: #1026928> Release notes for this change:Change <58> sets ROMMapInsert to true if CurMap is 1 so that linked patches in ROM wouldbe possible.  However, the if the Resource Manager sees 1 in CurMap, and thatROMMapInsert was true, it will reset CurMap to be SysMap when leaving the ResourceManager call.  This makes subsequent checks of CurMap invalid.  Instead of doing this,save CurMap in a register before getting any ‘lpch’ resources, and compare that against 1to determine if ROMMapInsert needs to be set before getting a linked patch resource.> What was tested:Slammed 1 into CurMap, and watched the code that loads all linked patch resources try toget them from ROM instead of from the system file.  Of course, it didn’t find any, andcrashed, but it was looking in ROM all the time which was the whole point of thisexercise.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------
