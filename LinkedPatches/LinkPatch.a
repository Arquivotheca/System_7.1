;	File:		LinkPatch.a
;
;	Contains:	a tiny bit of assembly for the patch linker
;
;				This file exists so that the patch linker can make decisions based on the number
;				of ROMs and conditions for the patches that it will link. These numbers are
;				calculated by the LinkedPatchMacros.a file, so this has to be in assembly.
