ROM timing tables now working.  I willstill need to finalize the contents of the tables with the results of a 6/23 meeting.Display modes can be flagged as ÒdoesnÕt need confirmationÓ.  Monitors does not ask theuser to verify mode switches to those ÒsafeÓ modes.Driver can also return information about the connection including that ALL modes aresafe.  This is for devices that KNOW that all the modes are safe.  Saves changing declROMs to include a table of timings.  I expect the portables to use this feature for640x400 mode switches.Also (hopefully) fixed pesky, occasional cursor-crash on mode switches.  Fix not requiredfor alpha.  Down side to this fix is that the cursor is reset (0, 0) on mode switches.  Iwill need to figure out exactly what is going on here.> What was tested:Built ROM and tested on PDM.  Mode switches to 13Ó & 16Ó modes donÕt requireconfirmation.  Switches to VGA and 12Ó modes do.  Tested that Òall modes safeÓ flagworks.  Tried and failed to reproduce cursor crash.  I now know that the mouse positionis outside of the pinrect at the time the cursor is drawn.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/25/93 9:41:39 AMFile: SonoraDriver.a,15     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºDeclDataºDeclVideoºSonoraºFile: Displays.a,5     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Displays.h,5     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DisplaysPriv.a,5     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºAsmºFile: DisplaysPriv.h,7     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºCºFile: DisplayMgr.c,9     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Changed DMAddDisplay to add device to devicelist and DMRemoveDisplay to remove devicefrom devicelist.  Added some new calls to support DMAddDisplay, DMRemoveDisplay and smartmonitors (see header and forthcoming ERS).Changed the display manager to clear get connection and get timing calls (rather than thedriver).  This was Mike PuckettÕs suggestion.  It makes it so if you add fields, olddrivers donÕt set only some of the fields.> What was tested:Build and tested ROM on PDM.  Mode switching still worked.  I to work with Max to be surethat DMAddDisplay and DMRemoveDisplay work.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/2/93 5:01:32 PMFile: CivicDriver.a,16     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºDeclDataºDeclVideoºCivicºFile: SonoraDriver.a,16     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºDeclDataºDeclVideoºSonoraºRadar bug: #1096920> Release notes for this change:Slot Manager not correctly updated in set resolution call.  Really sort of a slot managerbug: I use the slot manager to enable and disable the functional sResources, but I stillneed to call SUpdateSRT after I do so.> What was tested:Built and tested mode switching.  This is an identical fix to one made to esher driver.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
