If the KeyScript call with a particular verb does something useful, then the corresponding key combination is stripped from the event queue. The Cmd-rightArrow key combination is supposed to set the keyboard to Roman; this is not really useful on a Roman-only system. However, the KeyScript verb used with this key combination was smRoman; unfortunately, this verb is also used to update to the current Roman keyboard, and so it cannot be ignored by KeyScript even on a Roman-only system.Thus, Cmd-rightArrow was being stripped on a Roman-only system even when it did nothing useful. This prevented the use of this key combination for its Finder function.To solve this problem, I added another KeyScript verb, smKeyRoman. This verb also sets the keyboard to Roman, but it is ignored on a Roman-only system. Then I updated the KSWP resource to use this value instead of smRoman with the Cmd-rightArrow key combination.Changes:1. Added smKeyRoman to interface files: ScriptEqu.a, Script.h, Script.p.2. Updated KSWP template in SysTypes.r to include RomanIfOthers action for KSWP (corresponds to smKeyRoman).3. Modified KeyScript (file ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a) to support this new verb.4. Updated the KSWP data for the U.S. system (file International.r)> What was tested:Since the KeyScript change is being done by someone else, all I was able to do was build the System file with the other changes and use ResEdit to verify that the KSWP data was updated as described. Note that KeyScript will handle unimplemented verbs by doing nothing, so nothing bad will happen even if the KeyScript change does not get in.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
