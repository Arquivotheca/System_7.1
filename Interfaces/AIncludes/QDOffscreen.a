;
;		<10>	  7/1/92	DCL		This file is the replacement for the now obsolete
;									QDOffscreenEqu.a. Changed the 'including' name to match the new
;									file name.
;		 <9>	 6/14/91	JL		Checked in official MPW 3.2Ä version. Adjusted keepLocalBit's
;									comment; removed <27MAR90 KON>.
;		 <8>	 1/30/91	gbm		sab, #38: Change the Ôalready including this fileÕ variable to
;									all uppercase (for security reasons)
;		 <7>	 1/15/91	KON		Change useMFTempBit to UseTempMemBit. [csd]
;		 <5>	 3/27/90	KON		Add KeepLocal flag (bit3) for gWorld flags.
;		 <2>	12/28/89	dba		add equates for MF temp. memory bit
