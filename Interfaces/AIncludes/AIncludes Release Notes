AIncludes Release NotesFirst created on: 3/30/92 8:25:13 PM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------3/30/92 8:25:21 PMFile: ScriptEqu.a,47Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: SysTypes.r,25Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºRIncludesºFile: International.r,19Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºToolboxºScriptMgrºRadar bug: #1022875> Release notes for this change:(note that some files that are part of this change - Script.h, Script.p, ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a - are being changed by other people, so this change will appear in several places in the release notes)The KSWP resource specifies key combinations that result in a call to KeyScript with particular verbs. If the KeyScript call with a particular verb does something useful, then the corresponding key combination is stripped from the event queue. The Cmd-rightArrow key combination is supposed to set the keyboard to Roman; this is not really useful on a Roman-only system. However, the KeyScript verb used with this key combination was smRoman; unfortunately, this verb is also used to update to the current Roman keyboard, and so it cannot be ignored by KeyScript even on a Roman-only system.Thus, Cmd-rightArrow was being stripped on a Roman-only system even when it did nothing useful. This prevented the use of this key combination for its Finder function.To solve this problem, I added another KeyScript verb, smKeyRoman. This verb also sets the keyboard to Roman, but it is ignored on a Roman-only system. Then I updated the KSWP resource to use this value instead of smRoman with the Cmd-rightArrow key combination.Changes:1. Added smKeyRoman to interface files: ScriptEqu.a, Script.h, Script.p.2. Updated KSWP template in SysTypes.r to include RomanIfOthers action for KSWP (corresponds to smKeyRoman).3. Modified KeyScript (file ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a) to support this new verb.4. Updated the KSWP data for the U.S. system (file International.r)> What was tested:Since the KeyScript change is being done by someone else, all I was able to do was build the System file with the other changes and use ResEdit to verify that the KSWP data was updated as described. Note that KeyScript will handle unimplemented verbs by doing nothing, so nothing bad will happen even if the KeyScript change does not get in.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/3/92 3:09:04 PMFile: ScriptEqu.a,48Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºRadar bug: #1026378> Release notes for this change:Add CharType constants smCharContextualLR and smCharNonContextualLR. This is just assigning symbolic constants to the values that are already returned by CharType for Thai (smCharContextualLR), Cyrillic (smCharNonContextualLR), and other contextual and non-contextual left-right non-Roman characters.Changes to ScriptEqu.a, Script.[hp] (the latter were made by Don Louv).> What was tested:Full system build.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/8/92 12:01:09 PMFile: ScriptEqu.a,50Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Script.h,60Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: Script.p,58Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: ScriptPriv.a,63Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: ScriptPriv.h,23Owner: Peter Edberg     Project: MainProjºInternalºCºRadar bug: #1026516> Release notes for this change:Many of the script manager routines that depend on a grafport (to get a font => script code that determines their operation) have an alternate form in which a script code can be passed as a parameter; this is useful when a grafport may not be available. Until now, interfaces for these alternate forms are all private (although they are already being tested for Cube-E). They are now being made public, as various people need them, including N&C and El Kabong applications. The implementation of these routines is the same standard forms; the code that handles the script code parameter is in the Script Manager dispatcher, and it strips this parameter, so by the time we reach the routines themselves, the stack setup is the same as the normal way of calling these routines.These interfaces are: SCCharByte, SCCharType, SCFindWord, SCTransliterate, SCParseTable, SCLowerText, SCUpperText, SCStripText, SCStripUpperText.> What was tested:Full System file build (-e): there is no change in functionality, just moving interfaces. Pasted resulting Script Mgr patches into Cube-E 36++ and ran the system.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/9/92 6:07:35 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,52Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.h,53Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.p,47Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: Sys.r,304Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: GestaltFunction.a,42Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: GestaltPatches.a,31Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: PatchIIciROM.a,150Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºPatchesºFile: ShutDownMgr.a,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºShutDownMgrºFile: SoundMgrPatch.a,25Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºRadar bug: #1026795> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 100, we need to change boxFlag on Macintosh LC II machinesfrom its original value of boxMacLC to boxMacLCII in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltMacLCII.  This hasimplicationsin several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the machine icon tablefor Gestalt (the same icon as the LC) and a new string in the machine name STR# in theSystem (ÓMacintosh LC IIÓ), both of which show up in the Finder.  We need to make surethat Gestalt returns the same value for gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttras the Mac LC.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to set the CLUT to 50% gray on a restartas we do for an LC.  In the Sound Manager, we need to expand the sound primitive vectortableto include the LC II.> What was tested:On an LC II, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon andmachine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that the CLUT was set to 50%gray on restart, verified that sound input worked.  DidnÕt check the returned values forgestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr, though.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/21/92 4:40:17 PMFile: Traps.a,75Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Resources.h,12Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: Resources.p,8Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: ResourceMgrExtensions.a,45Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºResourceMgrºRadar bug: #1018901> Release notes for this change:With the Fonts folder, a font family can be split across several files.  This is a newbehaviour, andprograms that assume that a ÔFONDÕ will contain information about all the fonts belongingto thatfont family will be in for a surprise.  Provide a new call, GetNextFOND, which will takea handle toa ÔFONDÕ resource as a parameter, and it will return the next ÔFONDÕ resource in theresource chainbelonging to the same family.  The LaserWriter driver is currently the only client ofthis call.> What was tested:The bug states that MacWrite IIÕs ReadMe file does not print correctly under Cube-E.This was dueto the fact that the LaserWriter driver was looking for a style mapping table in thefirst GevenaÔFONDÕ it found.  This is the one in the system file, which does not have a style mappingtable.Because it does not find a style mapping table, it tries to download a bitmapped font.Instead, theLaserWriter driver should look for another Geneva ÔFONDÕ.The LaserWriter driver has been changed to call the new routine GetNextFOND to look foranotherÔFONDÕ for the same family if the ÔFONDÕ it has does not have a style mapping table.With this fix,MacWrite II can print itÕs ReadMe document without any problems, whereas it would printinCourier without the fix.GetNextFOND also has code which checks to see if the ÔFONDÕ is in an override map.  If itis,GetNextFOND will search for the map after the first non-override map after the overridemap, sothat the same ÔFONDÕ resource will not be returned all the time.  To test this, I placeda copy ofthe Geneve ÔFONDÕ, and the ÔNFNTÕs in the System into a Gibbly and tried to print theReadMe file.This also printed correctly.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/1/92 11:05:02 AMFile: TextServices.a,24Owner: Kenny S.

Abit was added to Gestalt called ÒgestaltPlayAndRecordÓ which tells you if a machine canplay and record simultaneously. If the bit is not set, the SndRecord() dialog knows thatit should turn off recording before playing the sound just recorded. Also,SndNewChannel() knows not to allow a channel to be opened while recording on an LC.> What was tested:Tested on a Mac LC, IIsi----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/2/92 9:20:58 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,55Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.h,56Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.p,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: InternalOnlyEqu.a,22Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: Sys.r,317Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: GestaltPatches.a,33Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: PatchIIciROM.a,153Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºPatchesºFile: ShutDownMgr.a,51Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºShutDownMgrºFile: SoundMgrLowLevel.a,32Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºFile: SoundMgrPatch.a,27Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºRadar bug: #1031451> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 140, we need to change boxFlag on PowerBook 145 machines fromits original value of boxPowerBook170 to boxPowerBook145 in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltPowerBook145.This has implications in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in themachine icon table for Gestalt (the same icon as the PowerBook 140) and a new string inthe machine name STR# in the System (ÓPowerBook 140.Ó for now, until we announce themachine (the period at the end will let you tell the difference in the meantime)), bothof which show up in the Finder.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to close the videodriver at shutdown or restart as we do for the 140 and 170. In the Sound Manager, we needto expand the sound primitive vector table to include the 145, and fool the Gestaltattribute table into thinking a 145 is really a 140.> What was tested:On a PowerBook 145, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right iconand machine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that playing a sound andsound input worked.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/23/92 1:44:39 PMFile: ScriptEqu.a,52Owner: Susan M.

A new bit has been defined ÔsmsfSynchUnstyledTEÕ; the default is 0 which means do not synchronize and 1 (obviously) means synchronize.  This allowseach script system to determine when they want to synchronize their keyboard and font, and it removes the special casing script knowledge from TextEdit.The script systems that currently want to synchronize include:Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic, HebrewThe script systems that currently do NOT want to synchronize include:Eastern European (Hungarian, Czechoslovakia, Poland), Thai, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Korean> What was tested:Using TeachText and MacDraw 1.9.5, I tested if the keyboard synchronized to the font.  I modified the Roman and Hebrew ÔitlbÕ to be set correctly (for synchronization) and then I tested on a system that included Roman, Hebrew, Thai and Japanese.  I made each of these the system script using ScriptSwitcher and the expected synchronization behavior was exhibited.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/15/92 8:16:45 PMFile: ToolUtils.a,25     Owner: Susan M.

This code fixes the 1081805,1086363 and a number ofunreported bugs that I found while preparing for alpha.  I fixed some patches that run on68K machines.  Several selectors have moved to the private range and so I reordered thepublic ones.  In order to not confuse older version of finder and monitors, the gestaltselector for display manager has changed from ÔudskÕ to ÔdplyÕ.  That way new codedoesnÕt see old code and old code doesnÕt see new.  There was a persistent multiplemonitor bug that would (if you worked at it) crash your system.  It depended on movingdisplays and then waving the cursor as the display manager rearranged the displays.  Ithink I have this fixed, but I will keep an eye on it.I also changed the interfaces a little to simplify walking ALL display (includinginactive ones).> What was tested:I have been building and testing with this code for some time.  I spend yesterday andtoday really hammering on it on both 68K and PDM machines.

The problem was that there were alway incompatibilitieswith some applications and/or performance penalties.New Implementation:Exchange the contents the old main device and the new main device so that cached handlesstill behave correctly.  There is no performance penalty and (so far) no applicationincompatibilities beyond those introduced by the change in size.  I dicussed all thesesolutions with Kon Othmer and we both feel this is the base strategy.  The only problemis that this implementation breaks the connection between a phsyical monitor and itsgDevice.Rejected implementations:ÊÊ(1) changing the lo-mem MainDevice field (apps cache this value),ÊÊ(2) introducing a dummy device in the device list that MainDevice points to andshadowing and disabling the real main device such that caching MainDevice handle works(some apps had problems and performance suffered because QD always take the multidevicecase, and boot code assumes that all devices in the device list are active screen devicesand therefore ÔscrnÕ resources are invalid if it finds an extra device),ÊÊ(3) introducing a dummy device BEFORE the device list and pointed MainDevice at it.Fixed the boot problems and the performance hit, but broke applications that assumeMainDevice is in device list (including MicroSoft Excel).Added compatibility model.  Conditionally compiled fixes in a separate file with someguildlines for making sure these fixes can be turned off.  The CloseView compatilbilityfix is the only one in use.WARNING:WARNING:  As of this check in, you must use either Pre-Display Manager Monitors CP orWARNING:  Psychic TV A4 Monitors CP.  The API changed slightly to clean up the interfaceWARNING:  and intermediate versions will crash.WARNING:> What was tested:Built and tested extension with Reality sources.  Margarita regressed most of theexisting bugs and things seemed to work.  I updated SuperMario from reality and built andtested resolution flipping and new version of monitors on PDM.
