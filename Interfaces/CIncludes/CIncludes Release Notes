Until now, interfaces for these alternate forms are all private (although they are already being tested for Cube-E). They are now being made public, as various people need them, including N&C and El Kabong applications. The implementation of these routines is the same standard forms; the code that handles the script code parameter is in the Script Manager dispatcher, and it strips this parameter, so by the time we reach the routines themselves, the stack setup is the same as the normal way of calling these routines.These interfaces are: SCCharByte, SCCharType, SCFindWord, SCTransliterate, SCParseTable, SCLowerText, SCUpperText, SCStripText, SCStripUpperText.> What was tested:Full System file build (-e): there is no change in functionality, just moving interfaces. Pasted resulting Script Mgr patches into Cube-E 36++ and ran the system.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/9/92 6:07:45 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,52Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.h,53Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.p,47Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: Sys.r,304Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: GestaltFunction.a,42Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: GestaltPatches.a,31Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: PatchIIciROM.a,150Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºPatchesºFile: ShutDownMgr.a,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºShutDownMgrºFile: SoundMgrPatch.a,25Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºRadar bug: #1026795> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 100, we need to change boxFlag on Macintosh LC II machinesfrom its original value of boxMacLC to boxMacLCII in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltMacLCII.  This hasimplicationsin several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the machine icon tablefor Gestalt (the same icon as the LC) and a new string in the machine name STR# in theSystem (ÓMacintosh LC IIÓ), both of which show up in the Finder.  We need to make surethat Gestalt returns the same value for gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttras the Mac LC.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to set the CLUT to 50% gray on a restartas we do for an LC.  In the Sound Manager, we need to expand the sound primitive vectortableto include the LC II.> What was tested:On an LC II, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon andmachine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that the CLUT was set to 50%gray on restart, verified that sound input worked.  DidnÕt check the returned values forgestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr, though.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/21/92 4:40:26 PMFile: Traps.a,75Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Resources.h,12Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: Resources.p,8Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: ResourceMgrExtensions.a,45Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºResourceMgrºRadar bug: #1018901> Release notes for this change:With the Fonts folder, a font family can be split across several files.  This is a newbehaviour, andprograms that assume that a ÔFONDÕ will contain information about all the fonts belongingto thatfont family will be in for a surprise.  Provide a new call, GetNextFOND, which will takea handle toa ÔFONDÕ resource as a parameter, and it will return the next ÔFONDÕ resource in theresource chainbelonging to the same family.  The LaserWriter driver is currently the only client ofthis call.> What was tested:The bug states that MacWrite IIÕs ReadMe file does not print correctly under Cube-E.This was dueto the fact that the LaserWriter driver was looking for a style mapping table in thefirst GevenaÔFONDÕ it found.  This is the one in the system file, which does not have a style mappingtable.Because it does not find a style mapping table, it tries to download a bitmapped font.Instead, theLaserWriter driver should look for another Geneva ÔFONDÕ.The LaserWriter driver has been changed to call the new routine GetNextFOND to look foranotherÔFONDÕ for the same family if the ÔFONDÕ it has does not have a style mapping table.With this fix,MacWrite II can print itÕs ReadMe document without any problems, whereas it would printinCourier without the fix.GetNextFOND also has code which checks to see if the ÔFONDÕ is in an override map.  If itis,GetNextFOND will search for the map after the first non-override map after the overridemap, sothat the same ÔFONDÕ resource will not be returned all the time.  To test this, I placeda copy ofthe Geneve ÔFONDÕ, and the ÔNFNTÕs in the System into a Gibbly and tried to print theReadMe file.This also printed correctly.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/1/92 11:05:10 AMFile: TextServices.a,24Owner: Kenny S.

Sostarted off by adding two new kinds of  windowkinds -- applicationFloatKind(6) andsystemFloatKind(7) -- in windows.h.  Then changed the routine imLayerMouseDown in theProcess Manager file Schedule.c to check the windowkind of the floating layer.  If it issystemFloatKind and the boolean RouteEvent (plus a couple of other extra safe conditions)is true the mousedown is sent to the swmDriver.  Otherwise, the event is sent to thefront process.  That way processes can open up the new style floating windows withoutbeing inline aware or having to rely on the swmdriver being around.> What was tested:Built the system ran it with Non-TSM aware application (KeyCaps) and tested with Kadokawathe TSM aware application from Japan.  Worked fine.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/18/92 3:54:16 PMFile: TextServices.a,25Owner: Kenny S.

Abit was added to Gestalt called ÒgestaltPlayAndRecordÓ which tells you if a machine canplay and record simultaneously. If the bit is not set, the SndRecord() dialog knows thatit should turn off recording before playing the sound just recorded. Also,SndNewChannel() knows not to allow a channel to be opened while recording on an LC.> What was tested:Tested on a Mac LC, IIsi----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/2/92 9:21:08 PMFile: GestaltEqu.a,55Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.h,56Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: GestaltEqu.p,50Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInterfacesºPInterfacesºFile: InternalOnlyEqu.a,22Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºInternalºAsmºFile: Sys.r,317Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºMakeºFile: GestaltPatches.a,33Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºOSºGestaltºFile: PatchIIciROM.a,153Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºPatchesºFile: ShutDownMgr.a,51Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºShutDownMgrºFile: SoundMgrLowLevel.a,32Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºFile: SoundMgrPatch.a,27Owner: Jeff Miller     Project: MainProjºToolboxºSoundMgrºRadar bug: #1031451> Release notes for this change:As we do for the PowerBook 140, we need to change boxFlag on PowerBook 145 machines fromits original value of boxPowerBook170 to boxPowerBook145 in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also needto add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltPowerBook145.This has implications in several areas of the System.

In the ShutDown Manager, we need to close the videodriver at shutdown or restart as we do for the 140 and 170. In the Sound Manager, we needto expand the sound primitive vector table to include the 145, and fool the Gestaltattribute table into thinking a 145 is really a 140.> What was tested:On a PowerBook 145, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right iconand machine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that playing a sound andsound input worked.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/17/92 1:24:03 PMFile: TextServices.h,45Owner: Kenny S.

This code fixes the 1081805,1086363 and a number ofunreported bugs that I found while preparing for alpha.  I fixed some patches that run on68K machines.  Several selectors have moved to the private range and so I reordered thepublic ones.  In order to not confuse older version of finder and monitors, the gestaltselector for display manager has changed from ÔudskÕ to ÔdplyÕ.  That way new codedoesnÕt see old code and old code doesnÕt see new.  There was a persistent multiplemonitor bug that would (if you worked at it) crash your system.  It depended on movingdisplays and then waving the cursor as the display manager rearranged the displays.  Ithink I have this fixed, but I will keep an eye on it.I also changed the interfaces a little to simplify walking ALL display (includinginactive ones).> What was tested:I have been building and testing with this code for some time.  I spend yesterday andtoday really hammering on it on both 68K and PDM machines.  It seems to be holding upwell, but I will be continuing my testing and bug fixes.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/22/93 2:54:17 AMFile: SonoraDeclVideo.r,11     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºDeclDataºDeclVideoºSonoraºFile: SonoraDriver.a,14     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºDeclDataºDeclVideoºSonoraºFile: Video.h,4     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DisplaysPriv.h,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºCºFile: DisplayMgr.a,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,8     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgrUtils.c,4     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Checkin for PDM A2 engineering build on 6/22/93.  ROM timing tables now working.  I willstill need to finalize the contents of the tables with the results of a 6/23 meeting.Display modes can be flagged as ÒdoesnÕt need confirmationÓ.  Monitors does not ask theuser to verify mode switches to those ÒsafeÓ modes.Driver can also return information about the connection including that ALL modes aresafe.  This is for devices that KNOW that all the modes are safe.  Saves changing declROMs to include a table of timings.  I expect the portables to use this feature for640x400 mode switches.Also (hopefully) fixed pesky, occasional cursor-crash on mode switches.  Fix not requiredfor alpha.  Down side to this fix is that the cursor is reset (0, 0) on mode switches.  Iwill need to figure out exactly what is going on here.> What was tested:Built ROM and tested on PDM.  Mode switches to 13Ó & 16Ó modes donÕt requireconfirmation.  Switches to VGA and 12Ó modes do.  Tested that Òall modes safeÓ flagworks.  Tried and failed to reproduce cursor crash.

Added some new calls to support DMAddDisplay, DMRemoveDisplay and smartmonitors (see header and forthcoming ERS).Changed the display manager to clear get connection and get timing calls (rather than thedriver).  This was Mike PuckettÕs suggestion.  It makes it so if you add fields, olddrivers donÕt set only some of the fields.> What was tested:Build and tested ROM on PDM.  Mode switching still worked.

The problem was that there were alway incompatibilitieswith some applications and/or performance penalties.New Implementation:Exchange the contents the old main device and the new main device so that cached handlesstill behave correctly.  There is no performance penalty and (so far) no applicationincompatibilities beyond those introduced by the change in size.  I dicussed all thesesolutions with Kon Othmer and we both feel this is the base strategy.  The only problemis that this implementation breaks the connection between a phsyical monitor and itsgDevice.Rejected implementations:ÊÊ(1) changing the lo-mem MainDevice field (apps cache this value),ÊÊ(2) introducing a dummy device in the device list that MainDevice points to andshadowing and disabling the real main device such that caching MainDevice handle works(some apps had problems and performance suffered because QD always take the multidevicecase, and boot code assumes that all devices in the device list are active screen devicesand therefore ÔscrnÕ resources are invalid if it finds an extra device),ÊÊ(3) introducing a dummy device BEFORE the device list and pointed MainDevice at it.Fixed the boot problems and the performance hit, but broke applications that assumeMainDevice is in device list (including MicroSoft Excel).Added compatibility model.  Conditionally compiled fixes in a separate file with someguildlines for making sure these fixes can be turned off.  The CloseView compatilbilityfix is the only one in use.WARNING:WARNING:  As of this check in, you must use either Pre-Display Manager Monitors CP orWARNING:  Psychic TV A4 Monitors CP.  The API changed slightly to clean up the interfaceWARNING:  and intermediate versions will crash.WARNING:> What was tested:Built and tested extension with Reality sources.  Margarita regressed most of theexisting bugs and things seemed to work.  I updated SuperMario from reality and built andtested resolution flipping and new version of monitors on PDM.  Everything seems fine.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/16/93 9:17:32 PMFile: Displays.a,7     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Displays.h,7     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DisplaysPriv.a,7     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºAsmºFile: DisplaysPriv.h,10     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºCºFile: DisplayMgr.a,9     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,13     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgrCompatibility.c,2     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgrUtils.c,7     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: #1099391> Release notes for this change:Synced to latest Reality changes.
