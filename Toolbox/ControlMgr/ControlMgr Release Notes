ControlMgr Release NotesFirst created on: 4/22/92 07:11:46 PM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/22/92 07:11:57 PMFile: ControlMgrPatches.a,7Owner: pete helme     Project: MainProjºToolboxºControlMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Implemented PatchDisposeControlForCorrectLayer, a new patch to _DisposeControl which setsup the correct layer for the owner of the control. It gets the owner of the control fromthe controlÕs record, findÕs itÕs parent and swaps the current layer to the correct one,restoring after calling the original trap code.> What was tested:works fine.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/21/92 11:23:17 AMFile: PopupCDEF.c,40Owner: Greg Marriott     Project: MainProjºToolboxºControlMgrºFile: PopupCDEF.h,19Owner: Greg Marriott     Project: MainProjºToolboxºControlMgrºRadar bug: #1030284> Release notes for this change:Fix an architectural problem with the pop-up CDEF.  The menu for each pop-up was beingleft in the menu list all the time, causing other pop-ups to find the wrong menu in thelist.  I changed the CDEF to only insert the menu into the list when it is needed, and toremove the menu from the list when it is not being used.  This alleviates the conflictcaused by two control panels that use different menus having the same resource ID.> What was tested:Ran the new CDEF and tested control panels, Standard File (it uses the CDEF), and severalapplications that either had their own menus or used the Comm. Toolbox (which makesextensive use of the CDEF).  No existing code broke (that I could see) and the conflictbetween the control panels disappeared.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
