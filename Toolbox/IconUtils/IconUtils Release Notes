I now use presence of user-defined bottlenecks or a non-zero picSave value inthe current port to decide whether or not to use CopyMask to render the icons.  This hasthe effect of fixing the bug and making CubeE save for Tsunami.> What was tested:Set up a case analogous to the problem with the Korean keybaord menu icon and determinedthat the icon data was correctly plotted.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
