;	Goofy shell to include PrintGlue.a in for stand-alone assembly.  This is so the
;	brain-dead assembler will stop complaining about a missing END statement at the end of
;	PrintGlue.a.  Adding an END statement to PrintGlue.a won't work, because it is included
;	in other files, and an END would prematurely stop the assembly.

	INCLUDE	'PrintGlue.a'
	
	END
