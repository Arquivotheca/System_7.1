Since Assert now just returns whatever Boolean was passed in, don’t call it at all.> What was tested:There is no difference in system behaviour before and after this change while using double byteTrueType fonts, which is what this code affects.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/1/92 10:27:13 AMFile: BassPatches.a,16Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫File: DiskCacheExtensions.proto,3Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫DiskCache∫Prototype∫File: DiskCacheExtensions.c,4Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫DiskCache∫Source∫File: PartialFontExtensions.proto,3Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Prototype∫File: PartialFontExtensions.c,4Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Source∫Radar bug: #1023997> Release notes for this change:InitializePartialFonts and InitializeDiskCache should be pascal function.> What was tested:Kanji TrueType works fine with a new ‘Two-Byte Script Extension’.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/1/92 11:15:40 AMFile: PartialFontExtensions.h,5Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Interface∫File: PartialFontExtensions.c,5Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Source∫Radar bug: #1025684> Release notes for this change:Instead of hard-coding, calculate the number of master pointers initially created in the partial font zone at runtime> What was tested:Modified the heap zone size given in the ‘Two-Byte Script Extension’, then the expected result were observed.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------4/2/92 2:48:44 PMFile: PartialFontExtensions.c,6Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Source∫Radar bug: #1025909> Release notes for this change:Remove calls to VerifyPartialFontStructures and the routine itself.  This routine just returns once it has been called, so it’s just wasting memory being there.  Don’t call it since it doesn’t doanything, and conditionalize out the routine to save some bytes.> What was tested:Booted system, and looked at routines which used to call it, and made sure there are no referencesto this routine.  Also looked for this routine’s name in the linked patch block, and it’s no longerthere, which means it is not being compiled.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/4/92 5:27:15 PMFile: fontPrivate.a,26Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫Asm∫File: BassPatches.a,17Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫File: PartialFontExtensions.c,7Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫FontMgr∫PartialFont∫Source∫Radar bug: #1034875> Release notes for this change:The partial TrueType code in Cube-E assumes that the partial font zone is always present.This is not the case in the base system.  If this code ever executes, it will dereferencenil, and if EvenBetterBusError is installed, crash.  Normally this code doesn’t execute,since Roman ‘sfnt’ resources will be able to load into memory successfully, and thepartial font code is not executed.  However, in low memory situations, if the ‘sfnt’fails to load, the partial font code will kick in and do strange things because there isno partial font zone.  To get around this, create a small, 5K partial font zone for thebase system for these low memory situations.  This also provides a degredation case.> What was tested:Excel would crash with a bus error in the partial font code if the partial font zone doesnot exist.  With this change, Excel does not crash.  Since WorldScript II creates apartial font zone as well, I added a check to see if a partial font zone already exists.If it does, and the existing zone is smaller than the requested zone size, the existingzone is destroyed and a new one created.  I verified that the base system’s 5K zone isreplaced by WorldScript II’s 150K zone when that script extension is installed.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------
