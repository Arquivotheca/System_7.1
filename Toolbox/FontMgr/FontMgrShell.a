;	Goofy shell to include FontMgr.a in for stand-alone assembly.  This is so the
;	brain-dead assembler will stop complaining about a missing END statement at the end of
;	FontMgr.a.  Adding an END statement to FontMgr won't work, because it is included
;	in other files, and an END would prematurely stop the assembly.

	INCLUDE	'FontMgr.a'
