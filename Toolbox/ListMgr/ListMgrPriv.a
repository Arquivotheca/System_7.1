; these are equates within the myFlags byte.
; NOTE: LVBadFit and LHBadFit are indexed by the constants v and h, respectively,
; so don't change them.
; Well, since we have documented lDoHAutoScroll and lDoHAutoScroll as 0 and 1 
; (IM IV-280) we have no choice but to change at least LVBadFit and LHasGrow - gp 12/2/86
