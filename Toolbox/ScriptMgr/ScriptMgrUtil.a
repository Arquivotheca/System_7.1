;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;		 <8>	 4/30/92	JSM		ScriptMgrDispatch.a and ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a now compiled
;									separately for ROM builds, don’t include them here, get rid of
;									conditionals: smgrUseStdExit is always true. This file has no
;									more conditionals.
;		 <7>	 5/24/90	PKE		Reorganized files: Moved ScriptUtil dispatcher and FontScript,
;									Font2Script, IntlScript to new file ScriptMgrDispatch.a. This is
;									included here (ptch 4) for 6.x, and included in
;									ScriptMgrExtTail.a (ptch 27) for 7.0. In the latter case, we
;									still have the BitBucket routines here because they are used by
;									the RomanUtil dispatcher.
;		 <6>	 5/11/90	PKE		Expand dispatch table for new internal routine _AddScriptFonts.
;		 <5>	  5/5/90	PKE		Expand dispatch table for new internal routines InitScripts and
;									InitKeybdMenu.
;		 <4>	 4/10/90	PKE		Use smgrSysVers, smgrROMVers, and forRom symbols instead of
;									buildLevel. Deleted conditionalized definition of SysVers. Moved
;									KeyScript, Get/SetEnvirons, and Get/SetScript into separate file
;									ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a which is included here. Started organizing
;									for ROMification of 7.0 extensions. Add export of FontScript,
;									IntlScript, Font2Script.
;		 <3>	 3/20/90	EMT		Removed unnecessary ROM85 references and oldMacTweek code.
;		 <2>	 3/19/90	PKE		Always export BitBucket and BitBucketReg. Use new feature
;									conditionals smgrUseStdExit and smgrUseDispTablePtr. Deleted old
;									definition: if forRom undefined, then forRom equ 0. Updated
;									header to BBS format and fixed tabs.
;		 <1>	12/18/89	CCH		Adding for the first time into BBS. Changed include 'inc.sum.a'
;									to load 'StandardEqu.d'. Updated file name references.
;
;	(BBS versions above, EASE versions below:)
;	   <2.7>	 9/18/89	PKE		Move KeyScript to ptch 27 so we can make a bug fix in itlk
;									processing for both old and new ROMs. Change its vector here to
;									be a dummy and stuff real address in ptch 27.
;	   <2.6>	 9/17/89	PKE		For 7.0, move Get/SetEnvirons and Get/SetScript to ptch 27.
;									Change the vectors for these routines to be dummy vectors here;
;									ptch 27 will stuff the real addresses.
;	   <2.5>	 9/15/89	PKE		Put in dummy vectors for TruncText, TruncString, ReplaceText,
;									and, yes, NFindWord again (we'll allow a direct call with
;									explicit specification of the break table, but the normal
;									FindWord call won't use this vector). Use smLowCall60x instead
;									of smLowCall for SysVers < $700, due to the fact that we can't
;									conditionalize ScriptEqu.a (it is part of a dumpfile).
;	   <2.4>	  9/5/89	PKE		Delete the NFindWord vector space from the dummy address table
;									created in 2.3, since we now have a different mechanism for
;									getting to NFindWord.
;	   <2.3>	  9/4/89	PKE		Add dummy addresses for 7.0 routines to utilTable, to force
;									allocation of space in dispatch table pointed to by
;									smgrDispTable. The real routine addresses will be filled in
;									later by SMgrExtTail.a (ptch 27).
;	   <2.2>	 8/26/89	PKE		Cleaned up some conditionals.
;	   <2.1>	 8/22/89	SES		Removed references to nFiles.
;	   <2.0>	 6/30/89	PKE		NEEDED FOR AURORA: Optimize table access in Get/SetEnvirons and
;									Get/SetScript (from code review).
;	   <1.9>	 6/23/89	PKE		Add four verbs to GetScript/SetScript which correspond to new
;									font&size information in ScriptRecord; skip definition of
;									buildLevel (done in ScriptEqu.priv).
;	   <1.8>	  6/5/89	PKE		Fix comments in CommonMapping, (ROM & 7.0 only) change a bgt to
;									a bpl
;	   <1.7>	 4/26/89	PKE		(ROM & 7.0 only) Change _ScriptUtil to use dispatch tables in
;									RAM, accessed through pointer/limits in SmgrRecord.
;	   <1.6>	  3/8/89	PKE		Change a BEQ.S to BEQ so Big Bang builds.
;	   <1.5>	  3/5/89	PKE		Use KeyScript patch from KeyHack.a for Big Bang (as well as ROM)
;	   <1.4>	 2/21/89	PKE		Replaced with RomProj version, which already had system and Rom
;									sources merged.
;	(EASE ROMproj history below)
;	   <1.5>	 2/21/89	PKE		Fix up includes: always use include 'inc.sum.a'.
;	   <1.4>	 2/14/89	PKE		Updated to use MPW 3.0 final ScriptEqu.a equate names
;	   <1.3>	  2/3/89	PKE		Merged with current system sources (CCH's 01/16/1989 merge of
;									6.0.3 and 7.0 sources, done in RES.sys:smgr)
;	   <1.2>	11/14/88	PKE		Synchronize EASE and Projector
;	   <1.1>	11/11/88	CCH		Fixed Header.
;	   <1.0>	 11/9/88	CCH		Adding to EASE.
;	(old EASE ROMproj history below)
;	   <1.7>	10/27/88	LDC		Mods by Carl Hewitt and Brian McGhie in the process of putting
;									Script Manager in ROM
;	(EASE SYSproj history below)
;	   <1.3>	 2/14/89	PKE		Updated to use MPW 3.0 final ScriptEqu.a equates
;	   <1.2>	 1/30/89	PKE		Fixed end of GetEnvirons to do "move.l d0,result(a6)" for all
;									systems, not just SysVers>=$700.
;	   <1.1>	 1/16/89	CCH		Merged 6.0.3 final sources into 7.0.
;	   <1.0>	11/16/88	CCH		Added to EASE.

;___________________________________________________________________________________________________
;	To Do (old):
;		Extend number of calls handled directly by script manager.
;		Remove aisTweaks for AIS 1.0 sometime in the near future.
;		Remove msTweaks for Microsoft sometime in the near future.
;		Remove mpwTweaks for MPW sometime in the near future.
