And updated 2 files to follow the declarations they need.> What was tested:Built CUBE-E.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/1/92 0:41:31File: MenuMgr.c,11Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1024445> Release notes for this change:Special handling for FONT resources with ID 0 (Chicago).  The script code for this FONT is taken to always be smRoman and not the current system script.  This resulted in Chicago being added twice to Font menus.> What was tested:Tested under the Hebrew script system using KeyCaps.  Before the fix, Chicago appeared as the 1st menu item, AND with the normal Roman fonts.  With the fix, it only appears in the Roman set (as expected).----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/4/92 22:32:55File: StandardMBDF.a,48Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1019367> Release notes for this change:Allow for a ÒslopÓ factor before system menus are dropped when application menus encroach on their space.  This space is configurable by the localizer (by setting the flags word of the MBDF).  The standard MBDF ships with this value equal to zero and thus has no change to its functionality with respect to System 7.0.> What was tested:MPW used to add menus to the menu bar until they ÒhitÓ the system menus.  Tested with just the Help menu and with Help and Keyboard menus.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/22/92 11:13:15 AMFile: MenuMgr.c,12Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1024445> Release notes for this change:The last fix to prevent Chicago from showing up in the View control panel menu when anon-Roman script is the primary script didnÕt work.  Move the line from the previouscheckin up above the line before it so that we can gaurantee the script code wonÕt matchif weÕre trying to insert ÔFONTÕ 0.> What was tested:Chicago does not show up in the Views control panel when Arabic is the primary script.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------4/30/92 1:48:25 PMFile: StandardMBDF.a,49Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1027995> Release notes for this change:TinyToons calls the standard menu bar definition procedureÕs BannerMsg routine, which isused by the Finder to draw the name of the launched application in the menu bar.BannerMsg calls routines which expect a4 to point to a menu record, but BannerMsg doesnot initialize a4.  Tiny Toons has garbage in a4, so the MBDF will bus error when ittries to reference something off of a4.  Changed the BannerMsg routine to initialize a4to 0, since the menu bar doesnÕt have a menu record, anyway.  Added a check for nil inthe SetTitleColor routine, which is where the crash occured.  If a4 is nil, the referenceto the offset that causes the crash is skipped.> What was tested:Watched FinderÕs call to BannerMsg, and stepped through the code to make sure that thecode that caused the crash is not executed any more.  This, by the way, saves a call to_GetMCEntry, which saves a few cycles when an application is launched.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/14/92 12:20:41File: MenuMgr.a,27Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºFile: SystemMenusPatch.a,12Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1029927> Release notes for this change:Roll out changes made to the Menu Manager files by the SuperMario team - back to the 7.01 versions.> What was tested:N/A - they worked before, the changes were organizational and not functional.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------5/14/92 12:48:18File: MenuMgr.a,28Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºFile: MenuMgrPatch.a,15Owner: Kevin MacDonell     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1028474> Release notes for this change:Two items:  The first was to fix the above bug - MenuKey is slow on two-byte systems as a result of upgrading to using SCUpperText over the old UprString.  MenuKey was upper-casing the command key even when there wasnÕt one (i.e., the command key was the ASCII character NULL).  This was quite inefficient since the common case is there is no command key.  On the Plus/SE I fixed the internal loop in MenuKey, on other ROMs, I updated the existing patch on _UprString to check for this case and skip calling SCUpperText when appropriate.The second item (Bug #1026551) is a patch on DrawMenuBar to synchronize the Keyboard Menu which is half of the fix for this bug.  Sue is implementing the other half of the fix in the ScriptMgr.  We created a new, private KeyScript verb to accomplish this.> What was tested:Linked patch INIT version of these changes were made and tested.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/6/92 3:28:17 PMFile: MenuMgrPatchII.a,10Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1034303> Release notes for this change:ItÕs entirely possible that the standard menu definition procedure can be called again bythe Menu Manager before itÕs exited the first time.  On the Mac II, the Menu Manager willlock the ÔMDEFÕ, call it, then unlock it.  However, if the ÔMDEFÕ was the one that calledthe Menu Manager, the ÔMDEFÕ is now unlocked, and if it makes a subsequent toolbox callthat moves memory, it will move out from under itself, and most problably crash with anillegal instruction.  Since the Menu Manager is almost entirely patched out on the MacII, change the routine DrawFirstItem which does this locking and unlocking so that itsaves the state of the handle, locks it, calls the ÔMDEFÕ, and restores the previousstate of the handle.  By doing this, if the ÔMDEFÕ was locked coming into this routine,it will stay locked.> What was tested:In FreeHand, under low memory conditions, Standard File will crash while drawing the popup part because the ÔMDEFÕ moved out from underneath itself.  With this change (whichKevin and Gil checked out in the compatibility lab), Standard File no longer crashes.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/24/92 6:23:33 PMFile: MenuMgrPatch.a,16Owner: Dean Yu     Project: MainProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: #1034303> Release notes for this change:The Menu Manager calls the ÔMDEFÕ with the CallMDEF utility routine.  This routine locksthe ÔMDEFÕ, calls it, unlocks it upon return, and returns to the caller.  CalcMenuSize isan example of such a routine.  The problem is that the ÔMDEFÕ calls CalcMenuSize itself,which causes the ÔMDEFÕ to get unlocked while itÕs still executing.  If the ÔMDEFÕ handleget relocated by the Memory Manager, youÕll crash.  Bracket calls to CalcMenuSize withcode that saves and restores the ÔMDEFÕ handle state.> What was tested:Verified that the ÔMDEFÕ was still locked after it called CalcMenuSize.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------11/5/93 10:01:57 AMFile: Displays.a,9     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºAIncludesºFile: Displays.h,10     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: Quickdraw.h,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: SysEqu.h,5     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: Video.h,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DisplaysPriv.a,11     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºAsmºFile: DisplaysPriv.h,14     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºCºFile: DisplayMgr.a,12     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,20     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgrOverlap.c,2     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: DisplayMgrUtils.c,11     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºFile: MenuMgr.a,20     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºMenuMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Rolled in Excelsior changes for PDM ROM.> What was tested:Built and booted a RISC ROM on coldfusion.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
