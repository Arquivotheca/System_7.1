ComponentMgr Release NotesFirst created on: 7/1/92 9:38:26 PM----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/1/92 9:38:38 PMFile: ThingManager.c,11     Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,38     Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProjºToolboxºTextServicesMgrºRadar bug: #1033507,1033505> Release notes for this change:We put a check into the ThingManager.c that would refuse to open a component if the slopin the system heap was too low.  However, I forgot that Bruce Leak told me that thethingmanager is super smart and clever and will put things into app heaps when systemmemory is too low.  That meant that in certain situations components that should havebeen opened in the app heap werenÕt being allowed to open because of lack of space in thesystem heap.So to fix this we moved the system heap check into TSM.  Since input methodÕs arenotorious memory hogs and also have to be opened in the system heap we check for systemheap slop after opening one of them.  If there isnÕt enough space we close the inputmethod.> What was tested:Ran the component test tools saw the attempt to open a component in the system heap fail,and then watched that component get opened in the application heap.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------7/2/93 4:51:10 PMFile: GestaltEqu.h,15     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInterfacesºCIncludesºFile: DepVideoEqu.a,47     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºInternalºAsmºFile: PPCInit.c,6     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºOSºPPCºFile: InitItt.c,19     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºOSºSCSIMgr4pt3ºFile: ThingManager.c,14     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: ThingManagerDisp.a,4     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: ThingManagerDispatcher.a,3     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºComponentMgrºFile: DisplayMgr.c,11     Owner: Ian Hendry     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºDisplayMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:Reality update:  Fix gestalt calls to use new prototype (not code change just typedeclarations).  Partially updated gestalt header file (except I did not move the errordeclarations that should probably be in Errors.h and I did not change the formattingdifferences).> What was tested:Build and tested.  Found one technically incorrect declaration (but implemented correctlyin assmbler.  Other than that everything seems to work fine.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
