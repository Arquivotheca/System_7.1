This happened because theComm Toolbox assumed that the pop up menus were always in the menu list, which is nolonger true.The Comm Toolbox was changed to no longer look in the menu list for the pop up menu.Instead, it looks inside the pop up menu data structure for the handle to the menu, whichis the documented way of getting the menu handle anyway.> What was tested:Both MacTerminal and LoCalChooser (a simple Comm Toolbox tool chooser) would fail when atool is picked, because the tool would call back to the Comm Toolbox for initialization.Comm Toolbox would then try to get the menu handle, fail, and pass that error all the wayback.  With this change, the tools all work properly, and you get some pretty massivedialogs with lots and lots of pop up menus.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/12/93 6:44:59 PMFile: CommResourceMgr.a,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommResourceMgrºFile: CommResourceMgrExtensions.c,4     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommResourceMgrºFile: CommResourceMgrUtilities.a,4     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommResourceMgrºFile: CommToolboxFix.a,3     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommToolboxStartupºFile: CommToolboxPatches.a,4     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommToolboxStartupºFile: CommToolboxPatches.c,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommToolboxStartupºFile: Choose.p,4     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommToolboxUtilitiesºChooseºFile: CommToolboxCore.c,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºCommToolboxUtilitiesºFile: ConnectionMgr.a,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºConnectionMgrºFile: ConnectionMgrExtensions.c,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºConnectionMgrºFile: FileTransferMgr.a,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºFileTransferMgrºFile: FileTransferMgrExtensions.c,3     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºFileTransferMgrºFile: TerminalMgrExtensions.c,2     Owner: kurt clark     Project: SuperMarioProjºToolboxºCommToolboxºTerminalMgrºRadar bug: > Release notes for this change:I stripped all of the ÒTheFutureÓ conditionals from all of the ComToolbox files per MikeBells instructions. I also had to delete some code that was conditionalized for ÒCubeEÓso that it would work.> What was tested: It would be nice if testing could bless this. I ran MacTerminal and it seems to work,but this is by no means adequate. I spoke with Alex Rosen, and he said that what I wasdoing should be ok, but that there was no test suite for the CommToolbox.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
