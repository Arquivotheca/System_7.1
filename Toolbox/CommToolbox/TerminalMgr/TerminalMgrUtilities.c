 * 	It wraps calls to ExecuteDef with calls to CRMToolPreflight and CRMToolPostflight.
 * 	These routines change the resource map so that curMap points to the system file
 * 	and the appropriate tool is the first resource file below the system file.  Also
 *	the CommToolbox is placed below the tool.  CRMToolPostflight undoes this.
