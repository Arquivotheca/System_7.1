Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1028881> Release notes for this change:If open IM for SWM’s document, set the zone to system zone so that the Component instance will not get closed when the application exits.> What was tested:If you quit any non-TSM aware app using KIM, KIM’s instance got closed. Now it does not get closed.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/1/92 11:19:25 AMFile: TSMDispatch.a,30Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,34Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1028301> Release notes for this change:Since we changed SWM to a driver, RestoreTSMDialogState, TSMChangeCursor, TSMRestoreCursor calls are no longer needed and should be removed from the source code.> What was tested:Design change.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/1/92 8:48:38 PMFile: TSMPrivate.a,21Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫Asm∫File: TSMPrivate.h,30Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫C∫File: TSMDispatch.a,31Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMFunctions.c,36Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1027482> Release notes for this change:If the mouse is over a floating window and input method changed cursor on it , then don’t let other application such as Finder to change the cursor again. (Patched _SetCursor). However, IM has to set the cursor as well when it puts out a dialog. Otherwise, Finder will change it to a watch.> What was tested:Cursor used to flash between IM’s and Finder’s over a floating window. Now it doesn’t.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/2/92 4:53:23 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,32Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: > Release notes for this change:Fix <31>.  Flush the parameter on the stack before return to a caller.> What was tested:Track code with MacsBug.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/4/92 3:35:15 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,33Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1025252> Release notes for this change:Patched _PaintBehind. AfterDark redraws the screen with FrontWindow(), and Grayrgn. This however,	does not draw input method’s floating windows. This patch will paint from IM layer if	theWindow = frontwindow, and theRegion = GrayRgn.> What was tested:Both “AfterDark” and “Pyro” are working with floating windows now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/6/92 10:10:53 AMFile: TSMFunctions.c,37Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,35Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1028642> Release notes for this change:When switch from a TSM document using Akiko to another TSM document using Roman script. Akiko’s pallete is still visible. Need to do some special checking when we activate the second document in non-CJK script.> What was tested:I tried switch from DOC1 (with Akiko) to DOC2 (use Roman), Akiko’s pallete got taken down now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/13/92 4:47:47 PMFile: TSMUtility.c,37Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: > Release notes for this change:To change NewServiceWindow so that we set windowKind to identify whether a floatingwindow belongs to an application or to the system.  We use the new window kindsapplicationFloatKind(6) and systemServiceKind(7).  If an application opens a floatingwindow it needs to pass kCurrentProcess as the ComponentInstance parameter.  When thishappens the windowKind gets set to applicationFloatKind.  If the caller of new servicewindow is anything other than kCurrentProcess the windowKind is set to systemFloatKind.> What was tested:Build the system tested the current input methods.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/14/92 6:59:19 PMFile: TSMPrivate.a,22Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫Asm∫File: TSMPrivate.h,31Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫C∫File: TSMDispatch.a,34Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1025797> Release notes for this change:Balloon help does not work when mouse is over a floating window. It is even worse when the help is in Finder because the Balloon window falshes. Now we check if the mouse is over our floating window, we’ll open the resource file from the owner of the window and try to get the Help resource from there. (Each floating window has a Component instance in the refCon which created the window). If resource file is not open, then we use a default string provided in Balloon.r.> What was tested:I tested with Akiko, KIM, and my Chinese IM which has Help resource. They all work in Finder and TeachText.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/18/92 3:54:28 PMFile: TextServices.a,25Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫AIncludes∫File: TextServices.h,43Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Interfaces∫CIncludes∫File: TSMFunctions.c,38Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1029814> Release notes for this change:NewTSMDocument didn’t check if supported type is the right type. Now it will check thenumber of interface type and check if the type is ‘tsvc’, if not it will return‘tsmUnsupportedTypeErr’. Also added ‘tsmUnsupportedTypeErr’ in TextServicesMgr.[ah].> What was tested:Tested with TSMTest tool TCS #4 and #6.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/19/92 5:17:54 PMFile: TSMPrivate.h,32Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫C∫File: TSMInternalUtils.c,21Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,38Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1029247> Release notes for this change:GetDefaultInputMethod, SetDefaultInputMethod, and SetTextServiceLanguage routines shouldcheck if user is passing the correct language code corresponding to the script code. Ifit is wrong, these calls return paramErr.> What was tested:Tested with TSM Test.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/20/92 12:43:23 PMFile: TSMUtility.c,39Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1030422> Release notes for this change:If we switch from SJip to KIM, and then to Akiko. Since the use old JIM flag is still setfor Japanese script, Akiko did not get activated. Changed SetDefaultInputMethod tospecial check for this case. If the flag is true, I’ll do the following:1. Set script flag to false,2. Set the use_old_JIM flag to false,3. Update the system resource file.> What was tested:Tested the input methods switching sequence SJip -> KIM -> Akiko, or SJip -> Roman ->Akiko.They all work fine.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------5/20/92 1:59:37 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,35Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1030447> Release notes for this change:A boolean passed in by C compiler is 4 bytes !! When xUseInputWindowcalls this routine and pass us the Boolean flag, I used MOVE.B to get the flag, which gotgarbage from the stack.> What was tested:Tested with Richard’s tool. work great.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/2/92 7:32:56 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,36Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMFunctions.c,39Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMInternalUtils.c,23Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,41Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1028635,1030481,1030631,1030634,1030647> Release notes for this change:Fixed bunch of Menu placement and drawing bugs by making input method menu system menus.Added a routine to add input method windows to the system menu by the standard method ofinserting into the menulist and system menulist, calling MBDF, and finally callingInvalMenuBar (TSMInternalUtils.c)Changed TSMFunctions to call the above routine when dealing with a new input method menu.TSMDispatch was changed to have the SystemMenu patchChanged FindServiceWindow in TSMUtility to fix a crashing bug discovered while working onthis (basically FindWindow crashes if MenuList is NIL) so before we call FindWindow wecheck the menulist.> What was tested:Built TSMInit, loaded it with New Akiko, rebooted, the menu comes up with an icon (purplepencil), and the menu works (used it to select Akiko help window).----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/4/92 1:37:40 PMFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,25Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031578> Release notes for this change:Input method’s menu showed up in the system menu when in a Roman script. We changedutDeleteMenu to make sure the menu is deleted from the system menu list if the systemscript does not use input method.> What was tested:Tried with Akiko in Roman system, the problem is gone.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/4/92 7:20:04 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,39Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031574> Release notes for this change:The HMGetBalloonPatch was leaving the old help window up when menus were pulled down whena floating text service window was open.To fix this we changed HMGetBalloonPatch to check the window part code for inSysWindowand inMenuBar, as well as inDesk.  If it is inSysWindow, inMenuBar or inDesk, we returnthe correct result for HMGetBalloon (i.e. the real result returned by the real trap).Formerly, we only returned the correct result when inDesk was returned.> What was tested:Built the system ran the new system with help on and Akiko windows open.  It doesn’tleave the old balloon up anymore.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/10/92 11:13:21 AMFile: TSMUtility.c,42Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031634> Release notes for this change:We patched HMGetBalloon to call FindServiceWindow for supportingfloating window. FindWindow will call MBDF when the mouse is pressedHowever, MBDF will call HMGetBalloon when Help is on and the mouseis pressed in the menu bar, HMGetBalloon will call MBDF because ofour patch. The MBDF code lock the menulist handle on entry, butunlock it on exit. So after the HMGetBalloon call, the handle is notlocked but MBDF keeps a dereferenced pointer, and ..... system willeventually crash. The fix is to save the handle state before andrestore it after the FindWindow call.> What was tested:We traced in debugger. Before the fix, the handle was not locked after theFindServiceWindow call. After the fix, now it remained locked.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/10/92 2:49:57 PMFile: TSMPrivate.a,24Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,43Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031142,1030881, 1030646> Release notes for this change:Since we removed the docID param from TSMEvent, UseInputWindow for individual documenthas been broken because keydown event is routed to SWM recursively. Fix it with a TSMglobal keeping track of which doc is using the input window and added a new private call-- TSMEventFromSWM. With this new call, TSM can avoid sending events to IM when a TSMaware application is using the Input Window. Changed many routines in TSM to keep thestate information correct.> What was tested:I have conducted a very thorough test with the help from Margarita S. and Shiao-Chen T.and a test tool from John H. It is working well.> •• Warning:	This change requires a new SWM driver. To use this version of TSM,   ••			you need WorldScript II A18 or later.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/10/92 3:32:58 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,41Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,44Owner: Yosuke Kurita     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031298> Release notes for this change:If the default input method is the old-Japanese input method, GetDefaultInputMethodreturns it even if it has not been loaded.   Fixed this.> What was tested:Built LinkedPatch.  Put Input methods, and take out the default one.  It doesn’t crash.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/13/92 5:51:13 PMFile: TSMPrivate.h,36Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Internal∫C∫File: TSMInternalUtils.c,27Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032463> Release notes for this change:Added a new routine -- utDeleteSysMenu to remove the menu from the system menulist, sothat it will not show up in other application’s menu bar. The menu is not removed fromthe current application’s menulist. So it always stays with the application. Useful whenswitch from a TSM aware application to Finder, we need to keep the pencil in that app’smenu but we don’t want to see it when we launch other applications. Called by‘utSuspendResumeApp’.> What was tested:Tested with Kadokawa with use input window ON, the Akiko’s pencil does not show up whenlaunch TeachText anymore.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/14/92 2:44:40 PMFile: TSMFunctions.c,41Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032466> Release notes for this change:Fixed the bug when running a TSM aware application in Roman primary script, select SJipand then Akiko, Akiko is not activated.> What was tested:I tried switch from Roman to SJip and then to Akiko, it works.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/16/92 3:54:03 PMFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,31Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032645> Release notes for this change:(Roman primary) In a TSM aware application, turn UseInputWindow ON, select a script whichhas no input method, turn UseInputWindow OFF, change to Akiko, Select another App’swindow. Althou we have Akiko’s icon but there is no pencil and can’t type in Japanese.Fixed in TSMInternalUtils.c.> What was tested:Tested with newKadokawa and TeachText. It works great.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/17/92 11:13:09 AMFile: TSMPrivate.a,26Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1030843> Release notes for this change:Balloon help in SWM’s popup menu did get cleared. The problem is because when the mouseis over a floating window, HMGetBalloon return false. We patched PopUpMenuSelect to set aflag so that HMGetBalloon can check and return the correct info when the mouse is over afloating window.> What was tested:Tested with SWM and other popup menus, it works ok now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/17/92 11:33:58 AMFile: TSMFunctions.c,44Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032643> Release notes for this change:1.  Boot up Cube-E b5 base and a18 WS II, Akiko, Sjip, and Korea from any system.2.  Launch “NewKadokawa”.3.  Select “Akiko” from the KEYBOARDS menu.4.  Close the document window.5.  Go back to the Finder.6.  Go back to NewKadokawa.  Notice that the “Pencil” menu will appear.> What was tested:Tested with the newKadokawa. It works now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/17/92 1:24:15 PMFile: TextServices.h,45Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032492> Release notes for this change:When switching input methods within the same script, need to delete the previous menu andthen insert the new one. In the case when input method does not have a menu, need to makesure no previous menu left over in the menu bar.> What was tested:I installed 3 more testing Korean input method in the system (running Korean as theprimary script). I can switch between them and see the correct menu displayed. Whenswitched to KIM, no menu displayed because KIM doesn’t have menu.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/22/92 9:22:36 AMFile: TextServices.h,46Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1030843> Release notes for this change:When the current active document is nil and we switch from old input method to TSM-styledinput method, need to reset the useOldJIM flag to flase. Added one new Apple Event‘ShowHideInputWindow’ in TextServices.h header file.> What was tested:Tested with Kadokawa, switch from old to new input method works now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/22/92 12:56:34 PMFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,35Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1032492> Release notes for this change:(For the #33 fix in TSMInternalUtils.c) When switching input methods, we need to removethe old input method’s menu from the system menulist I was using the wrong routine, Ishould use ‘utDeleteInputMethodsPreviousMenu’, not ‘utDeleteMenu’.> What was tested:Coding error.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/22/92 6:50:55 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,46Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1033280,1033495> Release notes for this change:The bus error occurs in PACK 14 (Help manager) after the _FrontWindow routine hasreturned a null for the front window. This is because I only checked inDesk for the partcode returned from FindServiceWindow, I really should check inSysWindow, and inMenu too.If the mouse is over the menu, Help Manager thinks it is over a floating window. Fixed inTSMDispatch.a.> What was tested:Homi tested with the TSMInit I built, and it is not crashing anymore.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/24/92 10:54:56 AMFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,36Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1033456> Release notes for this change:When CloseTSMAwareApplication() is called, I need to call utDeleteCleanUpTSMDocument().Defined the routine in this file. Also when we close an input method, we better take downits pallete too.> What was tested:Shiao-Chen tested with her tool and said the problem is fixed.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/26/92 12:18:14 PMFile: TSMPrivate.a,28Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1033450,1033456,1031316> Release notes for this change:This fixed 3 major probelms involving:1. After openning any dialog window in a TSM aware application which has no open windowwill cause Akiko to crash if you click in its pallete. The bug is due to TSM activate theinput method when a new document is created. This deactivates any active Akiko’s instance(a feature that I never knew). But the crashing part is actually a bug in Akiko.2. CloseTSMAwareApplication did not call Process Manager with InlineAware(false).3. Click the menu and move the mouse quickly over a floating window, sometimes theBalloon is not cleaned up. The HMGetBalloon should return true if it is called inside ofMenuSelect().> What was tested:All the cases are tested and they are happenning any more.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/26/92 4:46:00 PMFile: TSMDispatch.a,48Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1031142> Release notes for this change:When the application claims not TSM aware any more, we need to clear all UseInputWindowflags so it will not be reused when another TSM aware app is launched.> What was tested:We launch Kadokawa after quitting it with UseInputWindow global flag on and it is notusing input window now.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------6/30/92 6:12:20 PMFile: TSMUtility.c,52Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1030903,1033475> Release notes for this change:We had the agreement with the keyboard menu code that TSM will call SetScript(false) inSetDefaultInputMethod(). So I am making the change to do the right thing.> What was tested:We used to have the bug that old and new Japanese input method were not synchronizedcorrectly. Now it works.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/1/92 9:38:55 PMFile: ThingManager.c,11     Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫ComponentMgr∫File: TSMInternalUtils.c,38     Owner: John Harvey     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1033507,1033505> Release notes for this change:We put a check into the ThingManager.c that would refuse to open a component if the slopin the system heap was too low.  However, I forgot that Bruce Leak told me that thethingmanager is super smart and clever and will put things into app heaps when systemmemory is too low.  That meant that in certain situations components that should havebeen opened in the app heap weren’t being allowed to open because of lack of space in thesystem heap.So to fix this we moved the system heap check into TSM.  Since input method’s arenotorious memory hogs and also have to be opened in the system heap we check for systemheap slop after opening one of them.  If there isn’t enough space we close the inputmethod.> What was tested:Ran the component test tools saw the attempt to open a component in the system heap fail,and then watched that component get opened in the application heap.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/2/92 2:19:32 PMFile: TSMInternalUtils.c,39Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1034430> Release notes for this change:When handling input methods, in some cases I forgot to check if the script is one ofCCJK. If it is not we should not call utGetScriptIndex() because later on when accessingthe array, we’ll write to memory that does not belong to us and trashes the heap.> What was tested:Tested with kadokawa and the problem is gone.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/6/92 9:29:10 AMFile: TSMFunctions.c,50Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMInternalUtils.c,40Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫File: TSMUtility.c,53Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1033507,1033505> Release notes for this change:1. For the fix 38 in TSMInternalUtils.c, when we close the instance, need to callHidePalleteWindows().2. Don’t change the tsmScript/Language if utOpenIM4Document() failed. Need to put up anotification to warn the user (the later is not done yet, waiting for the bug to getapproved).3. Clear the kIMJustSetCursor bit before the SetTextServiceCursor() call so that IM canchange cursor from inside of the current input area.> What was tested:HidePalleteWindows() call is a noop if input method does not have pallete.

In SetTextServiceLanguage(), when we activate an input method, make sure we are notusing old JIM. If we are, don’t activate the TSM-styled Input Method.2. Changed the routine name utHasNoInputMethod() to utScriptIsNotCCJK() to be moredescriptive.3. If we can’t open input method because there is no IM, then don’t restore old stateinfo. KeyBoard menu will change the script ignoring our error code.> What was tested:Tested with Akiko and SJip, the pallete doesn’t show up now. We took out the ChineseIMand switch from Akiko to Chinese, or from KIM to Chinese, they all seem to work well.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/9/92 12:00:44 PMFile: TSMFunctions.c,52     Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1035067> Release notes for this change:When there is no TSM document in a TSM aware application, we call UseInputWindow(nil,true). But that fix did not check re-entrant case. So this bug happens. The fix is tocheck the flag, if it is already set, then we know we have been called again and justreturn.> What was tested:Tested with Kida-san’s new Kadokawa and the problem goes away.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/13/92 3:55:59 PMFile: TSMFunctions.c,53     Owner: Kenny S. Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1035594> Release notes for this change:In xActivateTSMDocument(), I assumed when a TSM aware application callsActivateTSMDocument(), the other document has been deactivated (as the ERS said). This isapparently not a wise assumption because application writer could be as dumb as me andwill make mistake. (Like the one they do to produce this bug).> What was tested:Tested with Kadokawa and cannot reproduce the bug anymore.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/16/92 7:11:27 PMFile: TSMPrivate.a,30     Owner: Kenny S.

Then if a non-TSM aware calls InitMenus and then calls GetNextEvent, SWMwill activate its document when it gets the accRun call from the system (as a result ofthe GetNextEvent call).  When the swm document is activated TSM will insert the inputmethods menu in the menulist.  The trouble with this is that if there are no menus in thelist (i.e. InitMenus was called but no insertMenu yet), the FEP menu will be the onlysystem menu in the menulist.  This apparently prevents the other system menus from beingadded.  So the eventual result is a menubar with the application menus and one sillylooking pencil hanging out on the right end. We fixed this by checking to see if thereare any menus in the menulist before we insert the FEP menu.  Change is inutCreateSystemVersionOfMenu.> What was tested:Ran EGBridge on Rubiks with an init that contained the change.  We didn’t have the pencilhanging out.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------7/27/92 9:09:32 AMFile: TSMDispatch.a,53     Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1038311> Release notes for this change:We can’t call application to fix input area when script changes (ie., Cmd-space) becausethe SetTextServiceLanguage() call is issued inside of the GetOSEventPatch of the ScriptManager code. When we are running inside of GetOSEvent(), the A5 points to ProcessManager’s global. If we call FixTSMDocument(), input method will send Apple Event to theapplication, and very bad things could happen when the application accesses its globals.> What was tested:The TSMChat used to crash because of this problem, now it doesn’t.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------8/4/92 3:11:13 PMFile: ScriptMgrKeyGetSet.a,50     Owner: Kenny S.

Tung     Project: MainProj∫Toolbox∫TextServicesMgr∫Radar bug: #1038603, #1038606> Release notes for this change:System crashes when Akiko’s last instance is closed because the menu handle has beendisposed but TSM still keeps a copy in the global.Fixed the problem in F1C4 by clearing the handle in the TSM global.•• Note: However, the final wisdom on handling input method's menu handle is thatinput method should NEVER dispose the menu even when the last instance is closed.This is because multiple applications can be running each with a menu in theapplication's menu list. If the input method disposes the menu while in one application,it will leave its handle in other applications becomes dangling. There is no way to solvethis problem other than hold the menu handle once its been created. Input method shouldkeep the menu handle in Component's Refcon for reuse. (See Component Manager ERS fordetails on using the Refcon).> What was tested:Kadokawa uses to crash with Akiko B7 when quit that application, now it works fine.----------------------------------------------------------•----------------------------------------------------------
