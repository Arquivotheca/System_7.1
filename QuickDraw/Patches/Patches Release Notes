Also added a specialcase loop for 1->16 and 1->32 (from Sean Callahan)  in ScaleBlt as well as a generalindexed->indexed loop. Changed the meaning of multColor to be a bitfield where bit 0means the source is black and white only. This allows us to take fast colorizing casesfor text. MakeScaleTbl was changed so that when colorizing it checks if it needs to toinvert the background color and does so appropriately. Changed the Font manager so thatit no longer marks synthetic fonts created with an arithmetic transfer mode as colorfonts.> What was tested:Checked colorized text drawing to all bit depths for II and IIci ROMs.Checked srcCopy and notSrcCopy CopyBits cases for indexed->indexed and indexed->directfor II and IIci ROMs (along with clipping and alignment cases).Tested inversion of background colour to 1 bit destinations when fg and bg colours aredifferent but map to the same index.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/10/92 12:21:43 AMFile: DrawingVars.a,13Owner: Shannon A.

Fixed a problem where StkLowPtand HiHeapMark were getting munged by Stretch in low memory situations. Fixed notSrcCopyand Search Proc problems> What was tested:Tested Aldus Freehand and Macromind Director on both Mac II and IIci. Tested notSrcCopyon both machines. Tested search procs on both machines.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------6/25/92 5:38:33 PMFile: QDciPatchROM.a,134Owner: Shannon A.

This was causing zero to be written to the alpha channelinstead of the apropriate alpha information. We now look at the actual stream mode in thecolor port along with the foreground and background longs in stretchÕs stack frame. Ifthey indicate that data is being drawn to the alpha channel we go slow, otherwise we takethe faster loops in ScaleBlt.> What was tested:Tested alpha channel drawing for CopyBits and all objects on Mac II and IIci ROMs usingarith to 16 and 32 bit destinations. Tested normal CopyBits cases to make sure theywerenÕt affected.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/13/92 8:59:13 PMFile: QuickDrawPatches.a,22     Owner: Shannon A.

This caused source bits to theleft of the desired area to be read.> What was tested:Tested on both a IIx and Quadra 700 using Hypercard and a 16 bit monitor. Saw no visualproblems. Verified in Macsbug that we hit the case of interest and that the code took thecorrect action.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------8/18/92 12:56:15 PMFile: QDciPatchROM.a,135     Owner: Shannon A.

When drawingto a one bit destination, MakeScaleTbl was checking if the foreground and backgroundcolors mapped to the same index. If so, the background color was inverted beforecolorizing. SeedCFill installs a one bit search proc that makes all non-seed colors mapto the same index. This was causing us to invert the background color when we didnÕt wantto. Consequently the resulting scale table mapped all indexes to non-seed colors and sothe SeedCFill did not work.To minimize risk, the fix is to check if the foreground is black and the background iswhite before inverting the background color. This is always true when coming fromSeedCFill. This reduces the affected cases to SeedCFill or a CopyBits from an indexedsource to a one bit destination with black foreground and white background which map tothe same index (because of a search proc).> What was tested:Tested SeedCFIll on Mac II and IIci roms. Also tested with Color MacCheese (flood fill),SearchGack, DTSÕs sample apps SeedCFill 32bit and SeedCFIll 8bit (which found the bug)and Tomato.----------------------------------------------------------¥----------------------------------------------------------
