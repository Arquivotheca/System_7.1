#	File:		DeleteObsolete
#
#	Contains:	Script to delete a user's local copies of obsolete files
#
#				Note:  You ¥must¥ execute an ObsoleteProjectorFile command for every file you
#				add to this script to obsolete all revisions of the file from the project.
#				Otherwise, people will just keep checking out and deleting the file on
#				their hard disk.  Using ObsoleteProjectorFile instead of DeleteRevisions allows
#				named revisions to work even though a file was obsoleted.
#
#				This script is specifically made for the SuperMario project, it should
#				it should never be rolled back into Reality.
