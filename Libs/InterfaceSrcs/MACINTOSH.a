;  macro  OsCall name
;
;  This macro is used to handle most of the low-level file manager calls which
;  take a Ptr to a parameter block and a Boolean sync/async flag as parameters.
;  The Ptr to the paramter block is loaded into a0, and the appropriate trap
;  call is made based on the sync flag.
